Chapter 1 Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3 and waited for justice;vengeance on the men who had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonor her. The judge, a formidably heavy-featured man, rolled up the sleeves of his black robe as ifto physically chastise the two young men standing before the bench. His face was cold withmajestic contempt. But there was something false in all this that Amerigo Bonasera sensed butdid not yet understand. “You acted like the worst kind of degenerates,” the judge said harshly. Yes, yes, thoughtAmerigo Bonasera. Animals. Animals. The two young men, glossy hair crew cut, scrubbedclean-cut faces composed into humble contrition, bowed their heads in submission. The judge went on. “You acted like wild beasts in a jungle and you are fortunate you didnot sexually molest that poor girl or I’d put you behind bars for twenty years.” The judge paused,his eyes beneath impressively thick brows flickered slyly toward the sallow-faced AmerigoBonasera, then lowered to a stack of probation reports before him. He frowned and shrugged asif convinced against his own natural desire. He spoke again. “But because of your youth, your clean records, because of your fine families, andbecause the law in its majesty does not seek vengeance, I hereby sentence you to three years’confinement to the penitentiary. Sentence to be suspended.” Only forty years of professional mourning kept the overwhelming frustration and hatredfrom showing on Amerigo Bonasera’s face. His beautiful young daughter was still in the hospitalwith her broken jaw wired together; and now these two animales went free? It had all been afarce. He watched the happy parents cluster around their darling sons. Oh, they were all happynow, they were smiling now. The black bile, sourly bitter, rose in Bonasera’s throat, overflowed through tightlyclenched teeth. He used his white linen pocket handkerchief and held it against his lips. He wasstanding so when the two young men strode freely up the aisle, confident and cool-eyed, smiling,not giving him so much as a glance. He let them pass without saying a word, pressing the freshlinen against his mouth. The parents of the animales were coming by now, two men and two women his age but8more American in their dress. They glanced at him, shamefaced, yet in their eyes was an odd,triumphant defiance. Out of control, Bonasera leaned forward toward the aisle and shouted hoarsely, “You willweep as I have wept--I will make you weep as your children make me weep”--the linen at hiseyes now. The defense attorneys bringing up the rear swept their clients forward in a tight littleband, enveloping the two young men, who had started back down the aisle as if to protect theirparents. A huge bailiff moved quickly to block the row in which Bonasera stood. But it was notnecessary. All his years in America, Amerigo Bonasera had trusted in law and order. And he hadprospered thereby. Now, though his brain smoked with hatred, though wild visions of buying agun and killing the two young men jangled the very bones of his skull, Bonasera turned to hisstill uncomprehending wife and explained to her, “They have made fools of us.” He paused andthen made his decision, no longer fearing the cost. “For justice we must go on our knees to DonCorleone.” In a garishly decorated Los Angeles hotel suite, Johnny Fontane was as jealously drunkas any ordinary husband. Sprawled on a red couch, he drank straight from the bottle of scotch inhis hand, then washed the taste away by dunking his mouth in a crystal bucket of ice cubes andwater. It was four in the morning and he was spinning drunken fantasies of murdering his trampywife when she got home. If she ever did come home. It was too late to call his first wife and askabout the kids and he felt funny about calling any of his friends now that his career was plungingdownhill. There had been a time when they would have been delighted, flattered by his callingthem at four in the morning but now he bored them. He could even smile a little to himself as hethought that on the way up Johnny Fontane’s troubles had fascinated some of the greatest femalestars in America. Gulping at his bottle of scotch, he heard finally his wife’s key in the door, but he keptdrinking until she walked into the room and stood before him. She was to him so very beautiful,the angelic face, soulful violet eyes, the delicately fragile but perfectly formed body. On thescreen her beauty was magnified, spiritualized. A hundred million men allover the world were inlove with the face of Margot Ashton. And paid to see it on the screen. “Where the hell were you? Johnny Fontane asked.9 “Out fucking,” she said. She had misjudged his drunkenness. He sprang over the cocktail table and grabbed her bythe throat. But close up to that magical face, the lovely violet eyes, he lost his anger and becamehelpless again. She made the mistake of smiling mockingly, saw his fist draw back. Shescreamed, “Johnny, not in the face, I’m making a picture.” She was laughing. He punched her in the stomach and she fell to the floor. He fell on topof her. He could smell her fragrant breath as she gasped for air. He punched her on the arms andon the thigh muscles of her silky tanned legs. He beat her as he had beaten snotty smaller kidslong ago when he had been a tough teenager in New York’s Hell’s Kitchen. A painfulpunishment that would leave no lasting disfigurement of loosened teeth or broken nose. But he was not hitting her hard enough. He couldn’t. And she was giggling at him.Spread-eagled on the floor, her brocaded gown hitched up above her thighs, she taunted himbetween giggles. “Come on, stick it in. Stick it in, Johnny, that’s what you really want.” Johnny Fontane got up. He hated the woman on the floor but her beauty was a magicshield. Margot rolled away, and in a dancer’s spring was on her feet facing him. She went into achildish mocking dance and chanted, “Johnny never hurt me, Johnny never hurt me.” Thenalmost sadly with grave beauty she said, “You poor silly bastard, giving me cramps like a kid.Ah, Johnny, you always will be a dumb romantic guinea, you even make love like a kid. Youstill think screwing is really like those dopey songs you used to sing.” She shook her head andsaid, “Poor Johnny. Goodbye, Johnny.” She walked into the bedroom and he heard her turn thekey in the lock. Johnny sat on the floor with his face in his hands. The sick, humiliating despairoverwhelmed him. And then the gutter toughness that had helped him survive the jungle ofHollywood made him pick up the phone and call for a car to take him to the airport. There wasone person who could save him. He would go back to New York. He would go back to the oneman with the power, the wisdom he needed and a love he still trusted. His Godfather Corleone. The baker, Nazorine, pudgy and crusty as his great Italian loaves, still dusty with flour,scowled at his wife, his nubile daughter, Katherine, and his baker’s helper, Enzo. Enzo hadchanged into his prisoner-of-war uniform with its green-lettered armband and was terrified thatthis scene would make him late reporting back to Governor’s Island. One of the many thousands10of Italian Army prisoners paroled daily to work in the American economy, he lived in constantfear of that parole being revoked. And so the little comedy being played now was, for him, aserious business. Nazorine asked fiercely, “Have you dishonored my family? Have you given my daughtera little package to remember you by now that the war is over and you know America will kickyour ass back to your village full of shit in Sicily?” Enzo, a very short, strongly built boy, put his hand over his heart and said almost in tears,yet cleverly, “Padrone, I swear by the Holy Virgin I have never taken advantage of yourkindness. I love your daughter with all respect. I ask for her hand with all respect. I know I haveno right, but if they send me back to Italy I can never come back to America. I will never be ableto marry Katherine.” Nazorine’s wife, Filomena, spoke to the point. “Stop all this foolishness,” she said to herpudgy husband. “You know what you must do. Keep Enzo here, send him to hide with ourcousins in Long Island.” Katherine was weeping. She was already plump, homely and sprouting a faint moustache.She would never get a husband as handsome as Enzo, never find another man who touched herbody in secret places with such respectful love. “I’ll go and live in Italy,” she screamed at herfather. “I’ll run away if you don’t keep Enzo here.” Nazorine glanced at her shrewdly. She was a “hot number” this daughter of his. He hadseen her brush her swelling buttocks against Enzo’s front when the baker’s helper squeezedbehind her to fill the counter baskets with hot loaves from the oven. The young rascal’s hot loafwould be in her oven, Nazorine thought lewdly, if proper steps were not taken. Enzo must bekept in America and be made an American citizen. And there was only one man who couldarrange such an affair. The Godfather. Don Corleone. All of these people and many others received engraved invitations to the wedding of MissConstanzia Corleone, to be celebrated on the last Saturday in August 1945. The father of thebride, Don Vito Corleone, never forgot his old friends and neighbors though he himself nowlived in a huge house on Long Island. The reception would be held in that house and thefestivities would go on all day. There was no doubt it would be a momentous occasion. The warwith the Japanese had just ended so there would not be any nagging fear for their sons fighting in11the Army to cloud these festivities. A wedding was just what people needed to show their joy. And so on that Saturday morning the friends of Don Corleone streamed out of New YorkCity to do him honor. They bore cream-colored envelopes stuffed with cash as bridal gifts, nochecks. Inside each envelope a card established the identity of the giver and the measure of hisrespect for the Godfather. A respect truly earned. Don Vito Corleone was a man to whom everybody came for help, and never were theydisappointed. He made no empty promises, nor the craven excuse that his hands were tied bymore powerful forces in the world than himself. It was not necessary that he be your friend, itwas not even important that you had no means with which to repay him. Only one thing wasrequired. That you, you yourself, proclaim your friendship. And then, no matter how poor orpowerless the supplicant, Don Corleone would take that man’s troubles to his heart. And hewould let nothing stand in the way to a solution of that man’s woe. His reward? Friendship, therespectful title of “Don,” and sometimes the more affectionate salutation of “Godfather.” Andperhaps, to show respect only, never for profit, some humble gift--a gallon of homemade wine ora basket of peppered taralles specially baked to grace his Christmas table. It was understood, itwas mere good manners, to proclaim that you were in his debt and that he had the right to callupon you at any time to redeem your debt by some small service. Now on this great day, his daughter’s wedding day, Don Vito Corleone stood in thedoorway of his Long Beach home to greet his guests, all of them known, all of them trusted.Many of them owed their good fortune in life to the Don and on this intimate occasion felt free tocall him “Godfather” to his face. Even the people performing festal services were his friends.The bartender was an old comrade whose gift was all the wedding liquors and his own expertskills. The waiters were the friends of Don Corleone’s sons. The food on the garden picnic tableshad been cooked by the Don’s wife and her friends and the gaily festooned one-acre garden itselfhad been decorated by the young girl-chums of the bride. Don Corleone received everyone--rich and poor, powerful and humble--with an equalshow of love. He slighted no one. That was his character. And the guests so exclaimed at howwell he looked in his tux that an inexperienced observer might easily have thought the Donhimself was the lucky groom. Standing at the door with him were two of his three sons. The eldest, baptized Santino butcalled Sonny by everyone except his father, was looked at askance by the older Italian men; with12admiration by the younger. Sonny Corleone was tall for a first-generation American of Italianparentage, almost six feet, and his crop of bushy, curly hair made him look even taller. His facewas that of a gross Cupid, the features even but the bow-shaped lips thickly sensual, the dimpledcleft chin in some curious way obscene. He was built as powerfully as a bull and it was commonknowledge that he was so generously endowed by nature that his martyred wife feared themarriage bed as unbelievers once feared the rack. It was whispered that when as a youth he hadvisited houses of ill fame, even the most hardened and fearless putain, after an awed inspectionof his massive organ, demanded double price. Here at the wedding feast, some young matrons, wide-hipped, wide-mouthed, measuredSonny Corleone with coolly confident eyes. But on this particular day they were wasting theirtime. Sonny Corleone, despite the presence of his wife and three small children, had plans for hissister’s maid of honor, Lucy Mancini. This young girl, fully aware, sat at a garden table in herpink formal gown, a tiara of flowers in her glossy black hair. She had flirted with Sonny in thepast week of rehearsals and squeezed his hand that morning at the altar. A maiden could do nomore. She did not care that he would never be the great man his father had proved to be. SonnyCorleone had strength, he had courage. He was generous and his heart was admitted to be as bigas his organ. Yet he did not have his father’s humility but instead a quick, hot temper that ledhim into errors of judgment. Though he was a great help in his father’s business, there weremany who doubted that he would become the heir to it. The second son, Frederico, called Fred or Fredo, was a child every Italian prayed to thesaints for. Dutiful, loyal, always at the service of his father, living with his parents at age thirty.He was short and burly, not handsome but with the same Cupid head of the family, the curlyhelmet of hair over the round face and sensual bow-shaped lips. Only, in Fred, these lips werenot sensual but granite-like. Inclined to dourness, he was still a crutch to his father, neverdisputed him, never embarrassed him by scandalous behavior with women. Despite all thesevirtues he did not have that personal magnetism, that animal force, so necessary for a leader ofmen, and he too was not expected to inherit the family business. The third son, Michael Corleone, did not stand with his father and his two brothers but satat a table in the most secluded corner of the garden. But even there he could not escape theattentions of the family friends.13 Michael Corleone was the youngest son of the Don and the only child who had refusedthe great man’s direction. He did not have the heavy, Cupid-shaped face of the other children,and his jet black hair was straight rather than curly. His skin was a clear olive-brown that wouldhave been called beautiful in a girl. He was handsome in a delicate way. Indeed there had been atime when the Don had worried about his youngest son’s masculinity. A worry that was put torest when Michael Corleone became seventeen years old. Now this youngest son sat at a table in the extreme corner of the garden to proclaim hischosen alienation from father and family. Beside him sat the American girl everyone had heardabout but whom no one had seen until this day. He had, of course, shown the proper respect andintroduced her to everyone at the wedding, including his family. They were not impressed withher. She was too thin, she was too fair, her face was too sharply intelligent for a woman, hermanner too free for a maiden. Her name, too, was outlandish to their ears; she called herself KayAdams. If she had told them that her family had settled in America two hundred years ago andher name was a common one, they would have shrugged. Every guest noticed that the Don paid no particular attention to this third son. Michaelhad been his favorite before the war and obviously the chosen heir to run the family businesswhen the proper moment came. He had all the quiet force and intelligence of his great father, theborn instinct to act in such a way that men had no recourse but to respect him. But when WorldWar II broke out, Michael Corleone volunteered for the Marine Corps. He defied his father’sexpress command when he did so. Don Corleone had no desire, no intention, of letting his youngest son be killed in theservice of a power foreign to himself. Doctors had been bribed, secret arrangements had beenmade. A great deal of money had been spent to take the proper precautions. But Michael wastwenty-one years of age and nothing could be done against his own willfulness. He enlisted andfought over the Pacific Ocean. He became a Captain and won medals. In 1944 his picture wasprinted in Life magazine with a photo layout of his deeds. A friend had shown Don Corleone themagazine (his family did not dare), and the Don had grunted disdainfully and said, “He performsthose miracles for strangers.” When Michael Corleone was discharged early in 1945 to recover from a disabling wound,he had no idea that his father had arranged his release. He stayed home for a few weeks, then,without consulting anyone, entered Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and so he14left his father’s house. To return for the wedding of his sister and to show his own future wife tothem, the washed-out rag of an American girl. Michael Corleone was amusing Kay Adams by telling her little stories about some of themore colorful wedding guests. He was, in turn, amused by her finding these people exotic, and,as always, charmed by her intense interest in anything new and foreign to her experience. Finallyher attention was caught by a small group of men gathered around a wooden barrel of homemadewine. The men were Amerigo Bonasera, Nazorine the Baker, Anthony Coppola and Luca Brasi.With her usual alert intelligence she remarked on the fact that these four men did not seemparticularly happy. Michael smiled. “No, they’re not,” he said. “They’re waiting to see my fatherin private. They have favors to ask.” And indeed it was easy to see that all four men constantlyfollowed the Don with their eyes. As Don Corleone stood greeting guests, a black Chevrolet sedan came to a stop on the farside of the paved mall. Two men in the front seat pulled notebooks from their jackets and, withno attempt at concealment, jotted down license numbers of the other cars parked around the mall.Sonny turned to his father and said, “Those guys over there must be cops.” Don Corleone shrugged. “I don’t own the street. They can do what they please.” Sonny’s heavy Cupid face grew red with anger. “Those lousy bastards, they don’t respectanything.” He left the steps of the house and walked across the mall to where the black sedanwas parked. He thrust his face angrily close to the face of the driver, who did not flinch butflapped open his wallet to show a green identification card. Sonny stepped back without saying aword. He spat so that the spittle hit the back door of the sedan and walked away. He was hopingthe driver would get out of the sedan and come after him, on the mall, but nothing happened.When he reached the steps he said to his father, “Those guys are FBI men. They’re taking downall the license numbers. Snotty bastards.” Don Corleone knew who they were. His closest and most intimate friends had beenadvised to attend the wedding in automobiles not their own. And though he disapproved of hisson’s foolish display of anger, the tantrum served a purpose. It would convince the interlopersthat their presence was unexpected and unprepared for. So Don Corleone himself was not angry.He had long ago learned that society imposes insults that must be borne, comforted by theknowledge that in this world there comes a time when the most humble of men, if he keeps hiseyes open, can take his revenge on the most powerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the15Don from losing the humility all his friends admired in him. But now in the garden behind the house, a four-piece band began to play. All the guestshad arrived. Don Corleone put the intruders out of his mind and led his two sons to the weddingfeast. There were, now, hundreds of guests in the huge garden, some dancing on the woodenplatform bedecked with flowers, others sitting at long tables piled high with spicy food andgallon jugs of black, homemade wine. The bride, Connie Corleone, sat in splendor at a specialraised table with her groom, the maid of honor, bridesmaids and ushers. It was a rustic setting inthe old Italian style. Not to the bride’s taste, but Connie had consented to a “guinea” wedding toplease her father because she had so displeased him in her choice of a husband. The groom, Carlo Rizzi, was a half-breed, born of a Sicilian father and the North Italianmother from whom he had inherited his blond hair and blue eyes. His parents lived in Nevadaand Carlo had left that state because of a little trouble with the law. In New York he met SonnyCorleone and so met the sister. Don Corleone, of course, sent trusted friends to Nevada and theyreported that Carlo’s police trouble was a youthful indiscretion with a gun, not serious, that couldeasily be wiped off the books to leave the youth with a clean record. They also came back withdetailed information on legal gambling in Nevada which greatly interested the Don and which hehad been pondering over since. It was part of the Don’s greatness that he profited fromeverything. Connie Corleone was a not quite pretty girl, thin and nervous and certain to becomeshrewish later in life. But today, transformed by her white bridal gown and eager virginity, shewas so radiant as to be almost beautiful. Beneath the wooden table her hand rested on themuscular thigh of her groom. Her Cupid-bow mouth pouted to give him an airy kiss. She thought him incredibly handsome. Carlo Rizzi had worked in the open desert airwhile very young--heavy laborer’s work. Now he had tremendous forearms and his shouldersbulged the jacket of his tux. He basked in the adoring eyes of his bride and filled her glass withwine. He was elaborately courteous to her as if they were both actors in a play. But his eyes keptflickering toward the huge silk purse the bride wore on her right shoulder and which was nowstuffed full of money envelopes. How much did it hold? Ten thousand? Twenty thousand? CarloRizzi smiled. It was only the beginning. He had, after all, married into a royal family. Theywould have to take care of him. In the crowd of guests a dapper young man with the sleek head of a ferret was alsostudying the silk purse. From sheer habit Paulie Gatto wondered just how he could go abouthijacking that fat pocketbook. The idea amused him. But he knew it was idle, innocent dreamingas small children dream of knocking out tanks with popguns. He watched his boss, fat,middle-aged Peter Clemenza whirling young girls around the wooden dance floor in a rustic andlusty Tarantella. Clemenza, immensely tall, immensely huge, danced with such skill andabandon, his hard belly lecherously bumping the breasts of younger, tinier women, that all theguests were applauding him. Older women grabbed his arm to become his next partner. Theyounger men respectfully cleared off the floor and clapped their hands in time to the mandolin’swild strumming. When Clemenza finally collapsed in a chair, Paulie Gatto brought him a glassof icy black wine and wiped the perspiring Jove-like brow with his silk handkerchief. Clemenzawas blowing like a whale as he gulped down the wine. But instead of thanking Paulie he saidcurtly, “Never mind being a dance judge, do your job. Take a walk around the neighborhood andsee everything is OK.” Paulie slid away into the crowd. The band took a refreshment break. A young man named Nino Valenti picked up adiscarded mandolin, put his left foot up on a chair and began to sing a coarse Sicilian love song.Nino Valenti’s face was handsome though bloated by continual drinking and he was already alittle drunk. He rolled his eyes as his tongue caressed the obscene lyrics. The women shriekedwith glee and the men shouted the last word of each stanza with the singer. Don Corleone, notoriously straitlaced in such matters, though his stout wife wasscreaming joyfully with the others, disappeared tactfully into the house. Seeing this, SonnyCorleone made his way to the bride’s table and sat down beside young Lucy Mancini, the maidof honor. They were safe. His wife was in the kitchen putting the last touches on the serving ofthe wedding cake. Sonny whispered a few words in the young girl’s ear and she rose. Sonnywaited a few minutes and then casually followed her, stopping to talk with a guest here and thereas he worked his way through the crowd. All eyes followed them. The maid of honor, thoroughly Americanized by three years ofcollege, was a ripe girl who already had a “reputation.” All through the marriage rehearsals shehad flirted with Sonny Corleone in a teasing, joking way she thought was permitted because hewas the best man and her wedding partner. Now holding her pink gown up off the ground, Lucy17Mancini went into the house, smiling with false innocence, ran lightly up the stairs to thebathroom. She stayed there for a few moments. When she came out Sonny Corleone was on thelanding above, beckoning her upward. From behind the closed window of Don Corleone’s “office,” a slightly raised comer room,Thomas Hagen watched the wedding party in the festooned garden. The walls behind him werestacked with law books. Hagen was the Don’s lawyer and acting Consigliere, or counselor, andas such held the most vital subordinate position in the family business. He and the Don hadsolved many a knotty problem in this room, and so when he saw the Godfather leave thefestivities and enter the house, he knew, wedding or no, there would be a little work this day. TheDon would be coming to see him. Then Hagen saw Sonny Corleone whisper in Lucy Mancini’sear and their little comedy as he followed her into the house. Hagen grimaced, debated whetherto inform the Don, and decided against it. He went to the desk and picked up a handwritten list ofthe people who had been granted permission to see Don Corleone privately. When the Donentered the room, Hagen handed him the list. Don Corleone nodded and said, “Leave Bonaserato the end.” Hagen used the French doors and went directly out into the garden to where thesupplicants clustered around the barrel of wine. He pointed to the baker, the pudgy Nazorine. Don Corleone greeted the baker with an embrace. They had played together as children inItaly and had grown up in friendship. Every Easter freshly baked clotted-cheese and wheat-germpies, their crusts yolk-gold, big around as truck wheels, arrived at Don Corleone’s home. OnChristmas, on family birthdays, rich creamy pastries proclaimed the Nazorines’ respect. And allthrough the years, lean and fat, Nazorine cheerfully paid his dues to the bakery union organizedby the Don in his salad days. Never asking for a favor in return except for the chance to buyblack-market OPA sugar coupons during the war. Now the time had come for the baker to claimhis rights as a loyal friend, and Don Corleone looked forward with great pleasure to granting hisrequest. He gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of yellow Strega and put his hand on theman’s shoulder to urge him on. That was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from bitterexperience what courage it took to ask a favor from a fellow man. The baker told the story of his daughter and Enzo. A fine Italian lad from Sicily; capturedby the American Army; sent to the United States as a prisoner of war; given parole to help our18war effort! A pure and honorable love had sprung up between honest Enzo and his shelteredKatherine but now that the war was ended the poor lad would be repatriated to Italy andNazorine’s daughter would surely die of a broken heart. Only Godfather Corleone could help thisafflicted couple. He was their last hope. The Don walked Nazorine up and down the room, his hand on the baker’s shoulder, hishead nodding with understanding to keep up the man’s courage. When the baker had finished,Don Corleone smiled at him and said, “My dear friend, put all your worries aside.” He went onto explain very carefully what must be done. The Congressman of the district must be petitioned.The Congressman would propose a special bill that would allow Enzo to become a citizen. Thebill would surely pass Congress. A privilege all those rascals extended to each other. DonCorleone explained that this would cost money, the going price was now two thousand dollars.He, Don Corleone, would guarantee performance and accept payment. Did his friend agree? The baker nodded his head vigorously. He did not expect such a great favor for nothing.That was understood. A special Act of Congress does not come cheap. Nazorine was almosttearful in his thanks. Don Corleone walked him to the door, assuring him that competent peoplewould be sent to the bakery to arrange all details, complete all necessary documents. The bakerembraced him before disappearing into the garden. Hagen smiled at the Don. “That’s a good investment for Nazorine. A son-in-law and acheap lifetime helper in his bakery all for two thousand dollars.” He paused. “Who do I give thisjob to?” Don Corleone frowned in thought. “Not to our paisan. Give it to the Jew in the nextdistrict. Have the home addresses changed. I think there might be many such cases now the waris over; we should have extra people in Washington that can handle the overflow and not raisethe price.” Hagen made a note on his pad. “Not Congressman Luteco. Try Fischer.” The next man Hagen brought in was a very simple case. His name was Anthony Coppolaand he was the son of a man Don Corleone had worked with in the railroad yards in his youth.Coppola needed five hundred dollars to open a pizzeria; for a deposit on fixtures and the specialoven. For reasons not gone into, credit was not available. The Don reached into his pocket andtook out a roll of bills. It was not quite enough. He grimaced and said to Tom Hagen, “Loan me ahundred dollars, ‘I’ll pay you back Monday when I go to the bank.” The supplicant protested thatfour hundred dollars would be ample, but Don Corleone patted his shoulder, saying,19apologetically, “This fancy wedding left me a little short of cash.” He took the money Hagenextended to him and gave it to Anthony Coppola with his own roll of bills. Hagen watched with quiet admiration. The Don always taught that when a man wasgenerous, he must show the generosity as personal. How flattering to Anthony Coppola that aman like the Don would borrow to loan him money. Not that Coppola did not know that the Donwas a millionaire but how many millionaires let themselves be put to even a small inconvenienceby a poor friend? The Don raised his head inquiringly. Hagen said, “He’s not on the list but Luca Brasiwants to see you. He understands it can’t be public but he wants to congratulate you in person.” For the first time the Don seemed displeased. The answer was devious. “Is it necessary?”he asked. Hagen shrugged. “You understand him better than I do. But he was very grateful that youinvited him to the wedding. He never expected that. I think he wants to show his gratitude.” Don Corleone nodded and gestured that Luca Brasi should be brought to him. In the garden Kay Adams was struck by the violet fury imprinted on the face of LucaBrasi. She asked about him. Michael had brought Kay to the wedding so that she would slowlyand perhaps without too much of a shock, absorb the truth about his father. But so far she seemedto regard the Don as a slightly unethical businessman. Michael decided to tell her part of thetruth indirectly. He explained that Luca Brasi was one of the most feared men in the Easternunderworld. His great talent, it was said, was that he could do a job of murder all by himself,without confederates, which automatically made discovery and conviction by the law almostimpossible. Michael grimaced and said, “I don’t know whether all that stuff is true. I do know heis sort of a friend to my father.” For the first time Kay began to understand. She asked a little incredulously, “You’re nothinting that a man like that works for your father?” The hell with it, he thought. He said, straight out, “Nearly fifteen years ago some peoplewanted to take over my father’s oil importing business. They tried to kill him and nearly did.Luca Brasi went after them. The story is that he killed six men in two weeks and that ended thefamous olive oil war.” He smiled as if it were a joke. Kay shuddered. “You mean your father was shot by gangsters?” “Fifteen years ago,” Michael said. “Everything’s been peaceful since then.” He was20afraid he had gone too far. “You’re trying to scare me,” Kay said. “You just don’t want me to marry you.” Shesmiled at him and poked his ribs with her elbow. “Very clever.” Michael smiled back at her. “I want you to think about it,” he said. “Did he really kill six men?” Kay asked. “That’s what the newspapers claimed,” Mike said. “Nobody ever proved it. But there’sanother story about him that nobody ever tells. It’s supposed to be so terrible that even my fatherwon’t talk about it. Tom Hagen knows the story and he won’t tell me. Once I kidded him, I said,‘When will I be old enough to hear that story about Luca?’ and Tom said, ‘When you’re ahundred.’ “ Michael sipped his glass of wine...That must be some story. That must be someLuca.” Luca Brasi was indeed a man to frighten the devil in hell himself. Short, squat,massive-skulled, his presence sent out alarm bells of danger. His face was stamped into a maskof fury. The eyes were brown but with none of the warmth of that color, more a deadly tan. Themouth was not so much cruel as lifeless; thin, rubbery and the color of veal. Brasi’s reputation for violence was awesome and his devotion to Don Corleone legendary.He was, in himself, one of the great blocks that supported the Don’s power structure. His kindwas a rarity. Luca Brasi did not fear the police, he did not fear society, he did not fear God, he did notfear hell, he did not fear or love his fellow man. But he had elected, he had chosen, to fear andlove Don Corleone. Ushered into the presence of the Don, the terrible Brasi held himself stiffwith respect. He stuttered over the flowery congratulations he offered and his formal hope thatthe first grandchild would be masculine. He then handed the Don an envelope stuffed with cashas a gift for the bridal couple. So that was what he wanted to do. Hagen noticed the change in Don Corleone. The Donreceived Brasi as a king greets a subject who has done him an enormous service, never familiarbut with regal respect. With every gesture, with every word, Don Corleone made it clear to LucaBrasi that he was valued. Not for one moment did he show surprise at the wedding gift beingpresented to him personally. He understood. The money in the envelope was sure to be more than anyone else had given. Brasi hadspent many hours deciding on the sum, comparing it to what the other guests might offer. He21wanted to be the most generous to show that he had the most respect, and that was why he hadgiven his envelope to the Don personally, a gaucherie the Don overlooked in his own flowerysentence of thanks. Hagen saw Luca Brasi’s face lose its mask of fury, swell with pride andpleasure. Brasi kissed the Don’s hand before he went out the door that Hagen held open. Hagenprudently gave Brasi a friendly smile which the squat man acknowledged with a polite stretchingof rubbery, veal-colored lips. When the door closed Don Corleone gave a small sigh of relief. Brasi was the only manin the world who could make him nervous. The man was like a natural force, not truly subject tocontrol. He had to be handled as gingerly as dynamite. The Don shrugged. Even dynamite couldbe exploded harmlessly if the need arose. He looked questioningly at Hagen. “Is Bonasera theonly one left?” Hagen nodded. Don Corleone frowned in thought, then said, “Before you bring him in,tell Santino to come here. He should learn some things.” Out in the garden, Hagen searched anxiously for Sonny Corleone. He told the waitingBonasera to be patient and went over to Michael Corleone and his girl friend. “Did you seeSonny around?” he asked. Michael shook his head. Damn, Hagen thought, if Sonny wasscrewing the maid of honor all this time there was going to be a mess of trouble. His wife, theyoung girl’s family; it could be a disaster. Anxiously he hurried to the entrance through which hehad seen Sonny disappear almost a half hour ago. Seeing Hagen go into the house, Kay Adams asked Michael Corleone, “Who is he? Youintroduced him as your brother but his name is different and he certainly doesn’t look Italian.” “Tom lived with us since he was twelve years old,” Michael said. “His parents died andhe was roaming around the streets with this bad eye infection. Sonny brought him home onenight and he just stayed. He didn’t have anyplace to go. He lived with us until he got married.” Kay Adams was thrilled. “That’s really romantic,” she said. “Your father must be awarmhearted person. To adopt somebody just like that when he had so many children of hisown.”. Michael didn’t bother to point out that immigrant Italians considered four children asmall family. He merely said, “Tom wasn’t adopted. He just lived with us.” “Oh,” Kay said, then asked curiously, “why didn’t you adopt him?” Michael laughed. “Because my father said it would be disrespectful for Tom to change22his name. Disrespectful to his own parents.” They saw Hagen shoo Sonny through the French door into the Don’s office and thencrook a finger at Amerigo Bonasera. “Why do they bother your father with business on a day likethis?” Kay asked. Michael laughed again. “Because they know that by tradition no Sicilian can refuse arequest on his daughter’s wedding day. And no Sicilian ever lets a chance like that go by.” Lucy Mancini lifted her pink gown off the floor and ran up the steps. Sonny Corleone’sheavy Cupid face, redly obscene with winey lust, frightened her, but she had teased him for thepast week to just this end. In her two college love affairs she had felt nothing and neither of themlasted more than a week. Quarreling, her second lover had mumbled something about her being“too big down there.” Lucy had understood and for the rest of the school term had refused to goout on any dates. During the summer, preparing for the wedding of her best friend, Connie Corleone, Lucyheard the whispered stories about Sonny. One Sunday afternoon in the Corleone kitchen,Sonny’s wife Sandra gossiped freely. Sandra was a coarse, good-natured woman who had beenborn in Italy but brought to America as a small child. She was strongly built with great breastsand had already borne three children in five years of marriage. Sandra and the other womenteased Connie about the terrors of the nuptial bed. “My God,” Sandra had giggled, “when I sawthat pole of Sonny’s for the first time and realized he was going to stick it into me, I yelledbloody murder. After the first year my insides felt as mushy as macaroni boiled for an hour.When I heard he was doing the job on other girls I went to church and lit a candle.” They had all laughed but Lucy had felt her flesh twitching between her legs. Now as she ran up the steps toward Sonny a tremendous flash of desire went through herbody. On the landing Sonny grabbed her hand and pulled her down the hall into an emptybedroom. Her legs went weak as the door closed behind them. She felt Sonny’s mouth on hers,his lips tasting of burnt tobacco, bitter. She opened her mouth. At that moment she felt his handcome up beneath her bridesmaid’s gown, heard the rustle of material giving way, felt his largewarm hand between her legs, ripping aside the satin panties to caress her vulva. She put her armsaround his neck and hung there as he opened his trousers. Then he placed both hands beneath herbare buttocks and lifted her. She gave a little hop in the air so that both her legs were wrapped23around his upper thighs. His tongue was in her mouth and she sucked on it. He gave a savagethrust that banged her head against the door. She felt something bumming pass between herthighs. She let her right hand drop from his neck and reached down to guide him. Her handclosed around an enormous, blood-gorged pole of muscle. It pulsated in her hand like an animaland almost weeping with grateful ecstasy she pointed it into her own wet, turgid flesh. The thrustof its entering, the unbelievable pleasure made her gasp, brought her legs up almost around hisneck, and then like a quiver, her body received the savage arrows of his lightning-like thrusts;innumerable, torturing; arching her pelvis higher and higher until for the first time in her life. shereached a shattering climax, felt his hardness break and then the crawly flood of semen over herthighs. Slowly her legs relaxed from around his body, slid down until they reached the floor.They leaned against each other, out of breath. It might have been going on for some time but now they could hear the soft knocking onthe door. Sonny quickly buttoned his trousers, meanwhile blocking the door so that it could notbe opened. Lucy frantically smoothed down her pink gown, her eyes flickering, but the thing thathad given her so much pleasure was hidden inside sober black cloth. Then they heard TomHagen’s voice, very low, “Sonny, you in there?” Sonny sighed with relief. He winked at Lucy. “Yeah, Tom, what is it?” Hagen’s voice, still low, said, “The Don wants you in his office. Now.” They could hearhis footsteps as he walked away. Sonny waited for a few moments, gave Lucy a hard kiss on thelips, and then slipped out the door after Hagen. Lucy combed her hair. She checked her dress and pulled around her garter straps. Herbody felt bruised, her lips pulpy and tender. She went out the door and though she felt the stickywetness between her thighs she did not go to the bathroom to wash but ran straight on down thesteps and into the garden. She took her seat at the bridal table next to Connie, who exclaimedpetulantly, “Lucy, where were you? You look drunk. Stay beside me now.” The blond groom poured Lucy a glass of wine and smiled knowingly. Lucy didn’t care.She lifted the grapey, dark red juice to her parched mouth and drank. She felt the sticky wetnessbetween her thighs and pressed her legs together. Her body was trembling. Over the glass rim, asshe drank, her eyes searched hungrily to find Sonny Corleone. There was no one else she caredto see. Slyly she whispered in Connie’s ear, “Only a few hours more and you’ll know what it’sall about.” Connie giggled. Lucy demurely folded her hands on the table, treacherously24triumphant, as if she had stolen a treasure from the bride. Amerigo Bonasera followed Hagen into the corner room of the house and found DonCorleone sitting behind a huge desk. Sonny Corleone was standing by the window, looking outinto the garden. For the first time that afternoon the Don behaved coolly. He did not embrace thevisitor or shake hands. The sallow-faced undertaker owed his invitation to the fact that his wifeand the wife of the Don were the closest of friends. Amerigo Bonasera himself was in severedisfavor with Don Corleone. Bonasera began his request obliquely and cleverly. “You must excuse my daughter, yourwife’s goddaughter, for not doing your family the respect of coming today. She is in the hospitalstill.” He glanced at Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen to indicate that he did not wish to speakbefore them. But the Don was merciless. “We all know of your daughter’s misfortune,” Don Corleone said. “If I can help her inany way, you have only to speak. My wife is her godmother after all. I have never forgotten thathonor.” This was a rebuke. The undertaker never called Don Corleone “Godfather” as customdictated. Bonasera, ashen-faced, asked, directly now, “May I speak to you alone?” Don Corleone shook his head. “I trust these two men with my life. They are my two rightarms. I cannot insult them by sending them away.” The undertaker closed his eyes for a moment and then began to speak. His voice wasquiet, the voice he used to console the bereaved. “I raised my daughter in the American fashion. Ibelieve in America. America has made my fortune. I gave my daughter her freedom and yettaught her never to dishonor her family. She found a ‘boy friend,’ not an Italian. She went to themovies with him. She stayed out late. But he never came to meet her parents. I accepted all thiswithout a protest, the fault is mine. Two months ago he took her for a drive. He had a masculinefriend with him. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. Sheresisted. She kept her honor. They beat her. Like an animal. When I went to the hospital she hadtwo black eyes. Her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered. They had to wire it together. Shewept through her pain. ‘Father, Father, why did they do it? Why did they do this to me?’ And Iwept.” Bonasera could not speak further, he was weeping now though his voice had not betrayedhis emotion.25 Don Corleone, as if against his will, made a gesture of sympathy and Bonasera went on,his voice human with suffering. “Why did I weep? She was the light of my life, an affectionatedaughter. A beautiful girl. She trusted people and now she will never trust them again. She willnever be beautiful again.” He was trembling, his sallow face flushed an ugly dark red. “I went to the police like a good American. The two boys were arrested. They werebrought to trial. The evidence was overwhelming and they pleaded guilty. The judge sentencedthem to three years in prison and suspended the sentence. They went free that very day. I stood inthe courtroom like a fool and those bastards smiled at me. And then I said to my wife: ‘We mustgo to Don Corleone for justice.”‘ The Don had bowed his head to show respect for the man’s grief. But when he spoke, thewords were cold with offended dignity. “Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come tome at the beginning of this affair?” Bonasera muttered almost inaudibly, “What do you want of me? Tell me what you wish.But do what I beg you to do.” There was something almost insolent in his words. Don Corleone said gravely, “ And what is that?” Bonasera glanced at Hagen and Sonny Corleone and shook his head. The Don, still sittingat Hagen’s desk, inclined his body toward the undertaker. Bonasera hesitated, then bent downand put his lips so close to the Don’s hairy ear that they touched. Don Corleone listened like apriest in the confessional, gazing away into the distance, impassive, remote. They stood so for along moment until Bonasera finished whispering and straightened to his full height. The Donlooked up gravely at Bonasera. Bonasera, his face flushed, returned the stare unflinchingly. Finally the Don spoke. “That I cannot do. You are being carried away.” Bonasera said loudly, clearly, “I will pay you anything you ask.” On hearing this, Hagenflinched, a nervous flick of his head. Sonny Corleone folded his arms, smiled sardonically as heturned from the window to watch the scene in the room for the first time. Don Corleone rose from behind the desk. His face was still impassive but his voice ranglike cold death. “We have known each other many years, you and I,” he said to the undertaker,“but until this day you never came to me for counselor help. I can’t remember the last time youinvited me to your house for coffee though my wife is godmother to your only child. Let us befrank. You spurned my friendship. You feared to be in my debt.” Bonasera murmured, “I didn’t want to get into trouble.”26 The Don held up his hand. “No. Don’t speak. You found America a paradise. You had agood trade, you made a good living, you thought the world a harmless place where you couldtake your pleasure as you willed. You never armed yourself with true friends. After all, thepolice guarded you, there were courts of law, you and yours could come to no harm. You did notneed Don Corleone. Very well. My feelings were wounded but I am not that sort of person whothrusts his friendship on those who do not value it--0n those who think me of little account.” TheDon paused and gave the undertaker a polite, ironic smile. “Now you come to me and say, ‘DonCorleone give me justice.’ And you do not ask with respect. You do not offer me your friendship.You come into my home on the bridal day of my daughter and you ask me to do murder and yousay--” here the Don’s voice became a scornful mimicry--” ‘I will pay you anything.’ No, no, Iam not offended, but what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?” Bonasera cried out in his anguish and his fear, “ America has been good to me. I wantedto be a good citizen. I wanted my child to be American.” The Don clapped his hands together with decisive approval. “Well spoken. Very fine.Then you have nothing to complain about. The judge has ruled. America has ruled. Bring yourdaughter flowers and a box of candy when you go visit her in the hospital. That will comfort her.Be content. After all, this is not a serious affair, the boys were young, high-spirited, and one ofthem is the son of a powerful politician. No, my dear Amerigo, you have always been honest. Imust admit, though you spurned my friendship, that I would trust the given word of AmerigoBonasera more than I would any other man’s. So give me your word that you will put aside thismadness. It is not American. Forgive. Forget. Life is full of misfortunes.” The cruel and contemptuous irony with which all this was said, the controlled anger ofthe Don, reduced the poor undertaker to a quivering jelly but he spoke up bravely again. “I askyou for justice.” Don Corleone said curtly, “The court gave you justice.” Bonasera shook his head stubbornly. “No. They gave the youths justice. They did notgive me justice.” The Don acknowledged this fine distinction with an approving nod, then asked, “What isyour justice?” “An eye for an eye,” Bonasera said. “You asked for more,” the Don said. “Your daughter is alive.”27 Bonasera said reluctantly, “Let them suffer as she suffers.” The Don waited for him tospeak further. Bonasera screwed up the last of his courage and said, “How much shall I payyou?” It was a despairing wail. Don Corleone turned his back. It was a dismissal. Bonasera did not budge. Finally, sighing, a good-hearted man who cannot remain angry with an erring friend, DonCorleone turned back to the undertaker, who was now as pale as one of his corpses. DonCorleone was gentle, patient. “Why do you fear to give your first allegiance to me?” he said.“You go to the law courts and wait for months. You spend money on lawyers who know fullwell you are to be made a fool of. You accept judgment from a judge who sells himself like theworst whore in the streets. Years gone by, when you needed money, you went to the banks andpaid ruinous interest, waited hat in hand like a beggar while they sniffed around, poked theirnoses up your very asshole to make sure you could pay them back.” The Don paused, his voicebecame sterner. “But if you had come to me, my purse would have been yours. If you had come to me forjustice those scum who ruined your daughter would be weeping bitter tears this day. If by somemisfortune an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies”--theDon raised his arm, finger pointing at Bonasera--”and then, believe me, they would fear you.” Bonasera bowed his head and murmured in a strangled voice, “Be my friend. I accept.” Don Corleone put his hand on the man’s shoulder...Good,” he said, “you shall have yourjustice. Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do me a service in return.Until that day, consider this justice a gift from my wife, your daughter’s godmother.” When the door closed behind the grateful undertaker, Don Corleone turned to Hagen andsaid, “Give this affair to Clemenza and tell him to be sure to use reliable people, people who willnot be carried away by the smell of blood. After all, we’re not murderers, no matter what thatcorpse valet dreams up in his foolish head.” He noted that his firstborn, masculine son wasgazing through the window at the garden party. It was hopeless, Don Corleone thought. If herefused to be instructed, Santino could never run the family business, could never become a Don.He would have to find somebody else. And soon. After all, he was not immortal. From the garden, startling all three men, there came a happy roaring shout. SonnyCorleone pressed close to the window. What he saw made him move quickly toward the door, adelighted smile on his face. “It’s Johnny, he came to the wedding, what did I tell you?” Hagen28moved to the window. “It’s really your godson,” he said to Don Corleone. “Shall I bring himhere?” “No,” the Don said. “Let the people enjoy him. Let him come to me when he is ready.”He smiled at Hagen. “You see? He is a good godson.” Hagen felt a twinge of jealousy. He said dryly, “It’s been two years. He’s probably introuble again and wants you to help.” “And who should he come to if not his godfather?” asked Don Corleone. The first one to see Johnny Fontane enter the garden was Connie Corleone. She forgother bridal dignity and screamed, “Johneee.” Then she ran into his arms. He hugged her tight andkissed her on the mouth, kept his arm around her as others came up to greet him. They were allhis old friends, people he had grown up with on the West Side. Then Connie was dragging himto her new husband. Johnny saw with amusement that the blond young man looked a little sour atno longer being the star of the day. He turned on all his charm, shaking the groom’s hand,toasting him with a glass of wine. A familiar voice called from the bandstand, “How about giving us a song, Johnny?” Helooked up and saw Nino Valenti smiling down at him. Johnny Fontane jumped up on thebandstand and threw his arms around Nino. They had been inseparable, singing together, goingout with girls together, until Johnny had started to become famous and sing on the radio. Whenhe had gone to Hollywood to make movies Johnny had phoned Nino a couple of times just totalk and had promised to get him a club singing date. But he had never done so. Seeing Ninonow, his cheerful, mocking, drunken grin, all the affection returned. Nino began strumming on the mandolin. Johnny Fontane put his hand on Nino’s shoulder.“This is for the bride,” he said, and stamping his foot, chanted the words to an obscene Sicilianlove song. As he sang, Nino made suggestive motions with his body. The bride blushed proudly,the throng of guests roared its approval. Before the song ended they were all stamping with theirfeet and roaring out the sly, double-meaning tag line that finished each stanza. At the end theywould not stop applauding until Johnny cleared his throat to sing another song. They were all proud of him. He was of them and he had become a famous singer, a moviestar who slept with the most desired women in the world. And yet he had shown proper respectfor his Godfather by traveling three thousand miles to attend this wedding. He still loved old29friends like Nino Valenti. Many of the people there had seen Johnny and Nino singing togetherwhen they were just boys, when no one dreamed that Johnny Fontane would grow up to hold thehearts of fifty million women in his hands. Johnny Fontane reached down and lifted the bride up onto the bandstand so that Conniestood between him and Nino. Both men crouched down, facing each other, Nino plucking themandolin for a few harsh chords. It was an old routine of theirs, a mock battle and wooing, usingtheir voices like swords, each shouting a chorus in turn. With the most delicate courtesy, Johnnylet Nino’s voice overwhelm his own, let Nino take the bride from his arm, let Nino swing intothe last victorious stanza while his own voice died away. The whole wedding party broke intoshouts of applause, the three of them embraced each other at the end. The guests begged foranother song. Only Don Corleone, standing in the comer entrance of the house, sensed something amiss.Cheerily, with bluff good humor, careful not to give offense to his guests, he called out, “Mygodson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat?” Atonce a dozen full wineglasses were thrust at Johnny Fontane. He took a sip from all and rushedto embrace his Godfather. As he did so he whispered something into the older man’s ear. DonCorleone led him into the house. Tom Hagen held out his hand when Johnny came into the room. Johnny shook it and said,“How are you, Tom?” But without his usual charm that consisted of a genuine warmth for people.Hagen was a little hurt by this coolness but shrugged it off. It was one of the penalties for beingthe Don’s hatchet man. Johnny Fontane said to the Don, “When I got the wedding invitation I said to myself,‘My Godfather isn’t mad at me anymore.’ I called you five times after my divorce and Tomalways told me you were out or busy so I knew you were sore.” Don Corleone was filling glasses from the yellow bottle of Strega. “That’s all forgotten.Now. Can I do something for you still? You’re not too famous, too rich, that I can’t help you?” Johnny gulped down the yellow fiery liquid and held out his glass to be refilled. He triedto sound jaunty. “I’m not rich, Godfather. I’m going down. You were right. I should never haveleft my wife and kids for that tramp I married. I don’t blame you for getting sore at me.” The Don shrugged. “I worried about you, you’re my godson, that’s all.” Johnny paced up and down the room. “I was crazy about that bitch. The biggest star in30Hollywood. She looks like an angel. And you know what she does after a picture? If the makeupman does a good job on her face, she lets him bang her. If the cameraman made her look extragood, she brings him into her dressing room and gives him a screw. Anybody. She uses her bodylike I use the loose change in my pocket for a tip. A whore made for the devil.” Don Corleone curtly broke in. “How is your family?” Johnny sighed. “I took care of them. After the divorce I gave Ginny and the kids morethan the courts said I should. I go see them once a week. I miss them. Sometimes I think I’mgoing crazy.” He took another drink. “Now my second wife laughs at me. She can’t understandmy being jealous. She calls me an old-fashioned guinea, she makes fun of my singing. Before Ileft I gave her a nice beating but not in the face because she was making a picture. I gave hercramps, I punched her on the arms and legs like a kid and she kept laughing at me.” He lit acigarette. “So, Godfather, right now, life doesn’t seem worth living.” Don Corleone said simply. “These are troubles I can’t help you with.” He paused, thenasked, “What’s the matter with your voice?” All the assured charm, the self-mockery, disappeared from Johnny Fontane’s face. Hesaid almost brokenly, “Godfather, I can’t sing anymore, something happened to my throat, thedoctors don’t know what.” Hagen and the Don looked at him with surprise, Johnny had alwaysbeen so tough. Fontane went on. “My two pictures made a lot of money. I was a big star. Nowthey throw me out. The head of the studio always hated my guts and now he’s paying me off.” Don Corleone stood before his godson and asked grimly, “Why doesn’t this man likeyou?” “I used to sing those songs for the liberal organizations, you know, all that stuff younever liked me to do. Well, Jack Woltz didn’t like it either. He called me a Communist, but hecouldn’t make it stick. Then I snatched a girl he had saved for himself. It was strictly a one-nightstand and she came after me. What the hell could I do? Then my whore second wife throws meout. And Ginny and the kids won’t take me back unless I come crawling on my hands and knees,and I can’t sing anymore. Godfather, what the hell can I do?” Don Corleone’s face had become cold without a hint of sympathy. He saidcontemptuously, “You can start by acting like a man.” Suddenly anger contorted his face. Heshouted. “LIKE A MAN!” He reached over the desk and grabbed Johnny Fontane by the hair ofhis head in a gesture that was savagely affectionate. “By Christ in heaven, is it possible that you spent so much time in my presence and turned out no better than this? A Hollywood finocchiowho weeps and begs for pity? Who cries out like a woman--’What shall I do? Oh, what shall Ido?’” The mimicry of the Don was so extraordinary, so unexpected, that Hagen and Johnnywere startled into laughter. Don Corleone was pleased. For a moment he reflected on how muchhe loved this godson. How would his own three sons have reacted to such a tongue-lashing?Santino would have sulked and behaved badly for weeks afterward. Fredo would have beencowed. Michael would have given him a cold smile and gone out of the house, not to be seen formonths. But Johnny, ah, what a fine chap he was, smiling now, gathering strength, knowingalready the true purpose of his Godfather. Don Corleone went on. “You took the woman of your boss, a man more powerful thanyourself, then you complain he won’t help you. What nonsense. You left your family, yourchildren without a father, to marry a whore and you weep because they don’t welcome you backwith open arms. The whore, you don’t hit her in the face because she is making a picture, thenyou are amazed because she laughs at you. You lived like a fool and you have come to a fool’send.” Don Corleone paused to ask in a patient voice, “ Are you willing to take my advice thistime?” Johnny Fontane shrugged. “I can’t marry Ginny again, not the way she wants. I have togamble, I have to drink, I have to go out with the boys. Beautiful broads run after me and I nevercould resist them. Then I used to feel like a heel when I went back to Ginny. Christ, I can’t gothrough all that crap again.” It was rare that Don Corleone showed exasperation. “I didn’t tell you to get married again.Do what you want. It’s good you wish to be a father to your children. A man who is not a fatherto his children can never be a real man. But then, you must make their mother accept you. Whosays you can’t see them every day? Who says you can’t live in the same house? Who says youcan’t live your life exactly as you want to live it?” Johnny Fontane laughed. “Godfather, not all women are like the old Italian wives. Ginnywon’t stand for it.” Now the Don was mocking. “Because you acted like a finocchio. You gave her more thanthe court said. You didn’t hit the other in the face because she was making a picture. You let32women dictate your actions and they are not competent in this world, though certainly they willbe saints in heaven while we men burn in hell. And then I’ve watched you all these years.” TheDon’s voice became earnest. “You’ve been a fine godson, you’ve given me all the respect. Butwhat of your other old friends? One year you run around with this person, the next year withanother person. That Italian boy who was so funny in the movies, he had some bad luck and younever saw him again because you were more famous. And how about your old, old comrade thatyou went to school with, who was your partner singing? Nino. He drinks too much out ofdisappointment but he never complains. He works hard driving the gravel truck and singsweekends for a few dollars. He never says anything against you. You couldn’t help him a bit?Why not? He sings well.” Johnny Fontane said with patient weariness, “Godfather, he just hasn’t got enough talent.He’s OK, but he’s not big time.” Don Corleone lidded his eyes almost closed and then said, “And you, godson, you now,you just don’t have talent enough. Shall I get you a job on the gravel truck with Nino?” WhenJohnny didn’t answer, the Don went on. “Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent.It is more than government. It is almost the equal of family. Never forget that. If you had built upa wall of friendships you wouldn’t have to ask me to help. Now tell me, why can’t you sing?You sang well in the garden. As well as Nino.” Hagen and Johnny smiled at this delicate thrust. It was Johnny’s turn to be patronizinglypatient. “My voice is weak. I sing one or two songs and then I can’t sing again for hours or days.I can’t make it through the rehearsals or the retakes. My voice is weak, it’s got some sort ofsickness.” “So you have woman trouble. Your voice is sick. Now tell me the trouble you’re havingwith this Hollywood pezzonovante who won’t let you work.” The Don was getting down tobusiness. “He’s bigger than one of your pezzonovantes, “ Johnny said. “He owns the studio. Headvises the President on movie propaganda for the war. Just a month ago he bought the movierights to the biggest novel of the year. A best seller. And the main character is a guy just like me.I wouldn’t even have to act, just be myself. I wouldn’t even have to sing. I might even win theAcademy Award. Everybody knows it’s perfect for me and I’d be big again. As an actor. But thatbastard Jack Woltz is paying me off, he won’t give it to me. I offered to do it for nothing, for a33minimum price and he still says no. He sent the word that if I come and kiss his ass in the studiocommissary, maybe he’ll think about it.” Don Corleone dismissed this emotional nonsense with a wave of his hand. Amongreasonable men problems of business could always be solved. He patted his godson on theshoulder. “You’re discouraged. Nobody cares about you, so you think. And you’ve lost a lot ofweight. You drink a lot, eh? You don’t sleep and you take pills?” He shook his headdisapprovingly. “Now I want you to follow my orders,” the Don said. “I want you to stay in my house forone month. I want you to eat well, to rest and sleep. I want you to be my companion, I enjoyyour company, and maybe you can learn something about the world from your Godfather thatmight even help you in the great Hollywood. But no singing, no drinking and no women. At theend of the month you can go back to Hollywood and this pezzonovante, this .90 caliber will giveyou that job you want. Done?” Johnny Fontane could not altogether believe that the Don had such power. But hisGodfather had never said such and such a thing could be done without having it done. “This guyis a personal friend of J. Edgar Hoover,” Johnny said. “You can’t even raise your voice to him.” “He’s a businessman,” the Don said blandly. “I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse.” “It’s too late,” Johnny said.” All the contracts have been signed and they start shooting ina week. It’s absolutely impossible.” Don Corleone said, “Go, go back to the party. Your friends are waiting for you. Leaveeverything to me.” He pushed Johnny Fontane out of the room. Hagen sat behind the desk, and made notes. The Don heaved a sigh and asked, “Is thereanything else?” “Sollozzo can’t be put off any more. You’ll have to see him this week.” Hagen held hispen over the calendar. The Don shrugged. “Now that the wedding is over, whenever you like.” This answer told Hagen two things. Most important, that the answer to Virgil Sollozzowould be no. The second, that Don Corleone, since he would not give the answer before hisdaughter’s wedding, expected his no to cause trouble. Hagen said cautiously, “Shall I tell Clemenza to have some men come live in the house?” The Don said impatiently, “For what? I didn’t answer before the wedding because on an34important day like that there should be no cloud, not even in the distance. Also I wanted to knowbeforehand what he wanted to talk about. We know now. What he will propose is an infamita.”Hagen asked, “Then you will refuse?” When the Don nodded, Hagen said, “I think weshould all discuss it--the whole Family--before you give your answer.” The Don smiled. “You think so? Good, we will discuss it. When you come back fromCalifornia. I want you to fly there tomorrow and settle this business for Johnny. See that moviepezzonovante. Tell Sollozzo I will see him when you get back from California. Is there anythingelse?” Hagen said formally, “The hospital called. Consigliere Abbandando is dying, he won’tlast out the night. His family was told to come and wait.” Hagen had filled the Consigliere’s post for the past year, ever since the cancer hadimprisoned Genco Abbandando in his hospital bed. Now he waited to hear Don Corleone say thepost was his permanently. The odds were against it. So high a position was traditionally givenonly to a man descended from two Italian parents. There had already been trouble about histemporary performance of the duties. Also, he was only thirty-five, not old enough, supposedly,to have acquired the necessary experience and cunning for a successful Consigliere.But the Don gave him no encouragement. He asked, “When does my daughter leave withher bridegroom?” Hagen looked at his wristwatch. “In a few minutes they’ll cut the cake and then a halfhour after that.” That reminded him of something else. “Your new son-in-law. Do we give himsomething important, inside the Family?” He was surprised at the vehemence of the Don’s answer. “Never.” The Don hit the deskwith the flat of his hand. “Never. Give him something to earn his living, a good living. But neverlet him know the Family’s business. Tell the others, Sonny, Fredo, Clemenza.” The Don paused. “Instruct my sons, all three of them, that they will accompany me to thehospital to see poor Genco. I want them to pay their last respects. Tell Freddie to drive the bigcar and ask Johnny if he will come with us, as a special favor to me.” He saw Hagen look at himquestioningly. “I want you to go to California tonight. You won’t have time to go see Genco. Butdon’t leave until I come back from the hospital and speak with you. Understood?” “Understood,” Hagen said. “What time should Fred have the car waiting?” “When the guests have left,” Don Corleone said. “Genco will wait for me.”35 “The Senator called,” Hagen said.” Apologizing for not coming personally but that youwould understand. He probably means those two FBI men across the street taking down licensenumbers. But he sent his gift over by special messenger.” The Don nodded. He did not think it necessary to mention that he himself had warned theSenator not to come. “Did he send a nice present?” Hagen made a face of impressed approval that was very strangely Italian on hisGerman-Irish features.” Antique silver, very valuable. The kids can sell it for a grand at least.The Senator spent a lot of time getting exactly the right thing. For those kind of people that’smore important than how much it costs.” Don Corleone did not hide his pleasure that so great a man as the Senator had shown himsuch respect. The Senator, like Luca Brasi, was one of the great stones in the Don’s powerstructure, and he too, with this gift, had resworn his loyalty. When Johnny Fontane appeared in the garden, Kay Adams recognized him immediately.She was truly surprised. “You never told me your family knew Johnny Fontane,” she said. “NowI’m sure I’ll marry you.” “Do you want to meet him?” Michael asked. “Not now,” Kay said. She sighed. “I was inlove with him for three years. I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitoland scream my head off. He was so wonderful.” “We’ll meet him later,” Michael said. When Johnny finished singing and vanished into the house with Don Corleone, Kay saidarchly to Michael, “Don’t tell me a big movie star like Johnny Fontane has to ask your father fora favor?” “He’s my father’s godson,” Michael said.” And if it wasn’t for my father he might not bea big movie star today.” Kay Adams laughed with delight. “That sounds like another great story.” Michael shook his head. “I can’t tell that one,” he said. “Trust me,” she said. He told her. He told her without being funny. He told it without pride. He told it withoutany sort of explanation except that eight years before his father had been more impetuous, andbecause the matter concerned his godson, the Don considered it an affair of personal honor.36 The story was quickly told. Eight years ago Johnny Fontane had made an extraordinarysuccess singing with a popular dance band. He had become a top radio attraction. Unfortunatelythe band leader, a well known show business personality named Les Halley, had signed Johnnyto a five-year personal services contract. It was a common show business practice. Les Halleycould now loan Johnny out and pocket most of the money. Don Corleone entered the negotiations personally. He offered Les Halley twentythousand dollars to release Johnny Fontane from the personal services contract. Halley offered totake only fifty percent of Johnny’s earnings. Don Corleone was amused. He dropped his offerfrom twenty thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars. The band leader, obviously not a man ofthe world outside his beloved show business, completely missed the significance of this loweroffer. He refused. The next day Don Corleone went to see the band leader personally. He brought with himhis two best friends, Genco Abbandando, who was his Consigliere, and Luca Brasi. With noother witnesses Don Corleone persuaded Les Halley to sign a document giving up all rights to allservices from Johnny Fontane upon payment of a certified check to the amount of ten thousanddollars. Don Corleone did this by putting a pistol to the forehead of the band leader and assuringhim with the utmost seriousness that either his signature or his brains would rest on thatdocument in exactly one minute. Les Halley signed. Don Corleone pocketed his pistol andhanded over the certified check. The rest was history. Johnny Fontane went on to become the greatest singing sensation inthe country. He made Hollywood musicals that earned a fortune for his studio. His records mademillions of dollars. Then he divorced his childhood-sweetheart wife and left his two children, tomarry the most glamorous blond star in motion pictures. He soon learned that she was a “whore.”He drank, he gambled, he chased other women. He lost his singing voice. His records stoppedselling. The studio did not renew his contract. And so now he had come back to his Godfather. Kay said thoughtfully, “ Are you sure you’re not jealous of your father? Everythingyou’ve told me about him shows him doing something for other people. He must begoodhearted.” She smiled wryly. “Of course his methods are not exactly constitutional.” Michael sighed. “I guess that’s the way it sounds, but let me tell you this. You knowthose Arctic explorers who leave caches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? Just incase they may need them someday? That’s my father’s favors. Someday he’ll be at each one of37those people’s houses and they had better come across.” It was nearly twilight before the wedding cake was shown, exclaimed over and eaten.Specially baked by Nazorine, it was cleverly decorated with shells of cream so dizzyinglydelicious that the bride greedily plucked them from the corpse of the cake before she whizzedaway on her honeymoon with her blond groom. The Don politely sped his guests’ departure,noting meanwhile that the black sedan with its FBI men was no longer visible. Finally the only car left in the driveway was the long black Cadillac with Freddie at thewheel. The Don got into the front seat, moving with quick coordination for his age and bulk.Sonny, Michael and Johnny Fontane got into the back seat. Don Corleone said to his son Michael,“Your girl friend, she’ll get back to the city by herself all right?” Michael nodded. “Tom said he’d take care of it.” Don Corleone nodded with satisfactionat Hagen’s efficiency. Because of the gas rationing still in effect, there was little traffic on the Belt Parkway toManhattan. In less than an hour the Cadillac rolled into the street of French Hospital. During theride Don Corleone asked his youngest son if he was doing well in school. Michael nodded. ThenSonny in the back seat asked his father, “Johnny says you’re getting him squared away with thatHollywood business. Do you want me to go out there and help?” Don Corleone was curt. “Tom is going tonight. He won’t need any help, it’s a simpleaffair.” Sonny Corleone laughed. “Johnny thinks you can’t fix it, that’s why I thought you mightwant me to go out there.” Don Corleone turned his head. “Why do you doubt me?” he asked Johnny Fontane.“Hasn’t your Godfather always done what he said he would do? Have I ever been taken for afool?” Johnny apologized nervously. “Godfather, the man who runs it is a real .90 caliberpezzonovante. You can’t budge him, not even with money. He has big connections. And he hatesme. I just don’t know how you can swing it.” The Don spoke with affectionate amusement. “I say to you: you shall have it.” He nudgedMichael with his elbow. “We won’t disappoint my godson, eh, Michael?” Michael, who never doubted his father for a moment, shook his head.38 As they walked toward the hospital entrance, Don Corleone put his hand on Michael’sarm so that the others forged ahead. “When you get through with college, come and talk to me,”the Don said. “I have some plans you will like.” Michael didn’t say anything. Don Corleone grunted in exasperation. “I know how you are.I won’t ask you to do anything you don’t approve of. This is something special. Go your ownway now, you’re a man after all. But come to me as a son should when you have finished withyour schooling.” The family of Genco Abbandando, wife and three daughters dressed in black, clusteredlike a flock of plump crows on the white tile floor of the hospital corridor. When they saw DonCorleone come out of the elevator, they seemed to flutter up off the white tiles in an instinctivesurge toward him for protection. The mother was regally stout in black, the daughters fat andplain. Mrs. Abbandando pecked at Don Corleone’s cheek, sobbing, wailing, “Oh, what a saintyou are, to come here on your daughter’s wedding day.” Don Corleone brushed these thanks aside. “Don’t I owe respect to such a friend, a friendwho has been my right arm for twenty years?” He had understood immediately that thesoon-to-be widow did not comprehend that her husband would die this night. GencoAbbandando had been in this hospital for nearly a year dying of his cancer and the wife hadcome to consider his fatal illness almost an ordinary part of life. Tonight was just another crisis.She babbled on. “Go in and see my poor husband,” she said, “he asks for you. Poor man, hewanted to come to the wedding to show his respect but the doctor would not permit it. Then hesaid you would come to see him on this great day but I did not believe it possible. Ah, menunderstand friendship more than we women. Go inside, you will make him happy.” A nurse and a doctor came out of Genco Abbandando’s private room. The doctor was ayoung man, serious-faced and with the air of one born to command, that is to say, the air of onewho has been immensely rich all his life. One of the daughters asked timidly, “Dr. Kennedy, canwe go to see him now?” Dr. Kennedy looked over the large group with exasperation. Didn’t these people realizethat the man inside was dying and dying in torturous pain? It would be much better if everyonelet him die in peace. “I think just the immediate family,” he said in his exquisitely polite voice.He was surprised when the wife and daughters turned to the short, heavy man dressed in an39awkwardly fitted tuxedo, as if to hear his decision. The heavy man spoke. There was just the slightest trace of an Italian accent in his voice.“My dear doctor,” said Don Corleone, “is it true he is dying?” “Yes,” said Dr. Kennedy. “Then there is nothing more for you to do,” said Don Corleone. “We will take up theburden. We will comfort him. We will close his eyes. We will bury him and weep at his funeraland afterwards we will watch over his wife and daughters.” At hearing things put so bluntly,forcing her to understand, Mrs. Abbandando began to weep. Dr. Kennedy shrugged. It was impossible to explain to these peasants. At the same timehe recognized the crude justice in the man’s remarks. His role was over. Still exquisitely polite,he said, “Please wait for the nurse to let you in, she has a few necessary things to do with thepatient.” He walked away from them down the corridor, his white coat flapping. The nurse went back into the room and they waited. Finally she came out again, holdingthe door for them to enter. She whispered, “He’s delirious with the pain and fever, try not toexcite him. And you can stay only a few minutes, except for the wife.” She recognized JohnnyFontane as he went by her and her eyes opened wide. He gave her a faint smile ofacknowledgment and she stared at him with frank invitation. He filed her away for futurereference, then followed the others into the sick man’s room. Genco Abbandando had run a long race with death, and now, vanquished, he layexhausted on the raised bed. He was wasted away to no more than a skeleton, and what had oncebeen vigorous black hair had turned into obscene stringy wisps. Don Corleone said cheerily,“Genco, dear friend, I have brought my sons to pay their respects, and look, even Johnny, all theway from Hollywood.” The dying man raised his fevered eyes gratefully to the Don. He let the young men clasphis bony hand in their fleshy ones. His wife and daughters ranged themselves along his bed,kissing his cheek, taking his other hand in turn. The Don pressed his old friend’s hand. He said comfortingly, “Hurry up and get betterand we’ll take a trip back to Italy together to our old village. We’ll play boccie in front of thewineshop like our fathers before us.” The dying man shook his head. He motioned the young men and his family away fromhis bedside; with the other bony claw he hung fast to the Don. He tried to speak. The Don put his40head down and then sat on the bedside chair. Genco Abbandando was babbling about theirchildhood. Then his coal-black eyes became sly. He whispered. The Don bent closer. The othersin the room were astonished to see tears running down Don Corleone’s face as he shook his head.The quavering voice grew louder, filling the room. With a tortured, superhuman effort,Abbandando lifted his head off his pillow, eyes unseeing, and pointed a skeletal forefinger at theDon. “Godfather, Godfather,” he called out blindly, “save me from death, I beg of you. My fleshis burning off my bones and I can feel the worms eating away my brain. Godfather, cure me, youhave the power, dry the tears of my poor wife. In Corleone we played together as children andnow will you let me die when I fear hell for my sins?” The Don was silent. Abbandando said, “It is your daughter’s wedding day, you cannotrefuse me.” The Don spoke quietly, gravely, to pierce through the blasphemous delirium. “Oldfriend,” he said, “I have no such powers. If I did I would be more merciful than God, believe me.But don’t fear death and don’t fear hell. I will have a mass said for your soul every night andevery morning. Your wife and your children will pray for you. How can God punish you with somany pleas for mercy?” The skeleton face took on a cunning expression that was obscene. Abbandando said slyly,“It’s been arranged then?” When the Don answered, his voice was cold, without comfort. “You blaspheme. Resignyourself.” Abbandando fell back on the pillow. His eyes lost their wild gleam of hope. The nursecame back into the room and started shooing them out in a very matter-of-fact way. The Don gotup but Abbandando put out his hand. “Godfather,” he said, “stay here with me and help me meetdeath. Perhaps if He sees you near me He will be frightened and leave me in peace. Or perhapsyou can say a word, pull a few strings, eh?” The dying man winked as if he were mocking theDon, now not really serious. “You’re brothers in blood, after all.” Then, as if fearing the Donwould be offended, be clutched at his hand. “Stay with me, let me hold your hand. We’ll outwitthat bastard as we’ve outwitted others. Godfather, don’t betray me.” The Don motioned the other people out of the room. They left. He took the withered clawof Genco Abbandando in his own two broad hands. Softly, reassuringly, he comforted his friend,as they waited for death together. As if the Don could truly snatch the life of Genco Abbandando41back from that most foul and criminal traitor to man. The wedding day of Connie Corleone ended well for her. Carlo Rizzi performed hisduties as a bridegroom with skill and vigor, spurred on by the contents of the bride’s gift pursewhich totaled up to over twenty thousand dollars. The bride, however, gave up her virginity witha great deal more willingness than she gave up her purse. For the latter, he had to blacken one ofher eyes. Lucy Mancini waited in her house for a call from Sonny Corleone, sure that he would askher for a date. Finally she called his house and when she heard a woman’s voice answer thephone she hung up. She had no way of knowing that nearly everyone at the wedding hadremarked the absence of her and Sonny for that fatal half hour and the gossip was alreadyspreading that Santino Corleone had found another victim. That he had “done the job” on hisown sister’s maid of honor. Amerigo Bonasera had a terrible nightmare. In his dreams he saw Don Corleone, inpeaked cap, overalls and heavy gloves, unloading bullet-riddled corpses in front of his funeralparlor and shouting, “Remember, Amerigo, not a word to anyone, and bury them quickly.” Hegroaned so loud and long in his sleep that his wife shook him awake. “Eh, what a man you are,”she grumbled. “To have a nightmare only after a wedding.” Kay Adams was escorted to her New York City hotel by Paulie Gatto and Clemenza. Thecar was large, luxurious and driven by Gat to. Clemenza sat in the back seat and Kay was giventhe front seat next to the driver. She found both men wildly exotic. Their speech was movieBrooklynese and they treated her with exaggerated courtliness. During the ride she chattedcasually with both men and was surprised when they spoke of Michael with unmistakableaffection and respect. He had led her to believe that he was an alien in his father’s world. NowClemenza was assuring her in his wheezing guttural voice that the “old man” thought Mike wasthe best of his sons, the one who would surely inherit the family business. “What business is that?” Kay asked in the most natural way. Paulie Gatto gave her a quick glance as he turned the wheel. Behind her Clemenza said ina surprised voice. “Didn’t Mike tell you? Mr. Corleone is the biggest importer of Italian olive oilin the States. Now that the war is over the business could get real rich. He’ll need a smart boylike Mike.”42 At the hotel Clemenza insisted on coming to the desk with her. When she protested, hesaid simply, “The boss said to make sure you got home OK. I gotta do it.” After she received her room key he walked her to the elevator and waited until she got in.She waved to him, smiling, and was surprised at his genuine smile of pleasure in return. It wasjust as well she did not see him go back to the hotel clerk and ask, “What name she registeredunder?” The hotel clerk looked at Clemenza coldly. Clemenza rolled the little green spitball hewas holding in his hand across to the clerk, who picked it up and immediately said, “Mr. and Mrs.Michael Corleone.” Back in the car, Paulie Gatto said, “Nice dame.” Clemenza grunted. “Mike is doing the job on her.” unless, he thought, they were reallymarried. “Pick me up early in the morning,” he told Paulie Gat to. “Hagen got some deal for usthat gotta be done right away.” It was late Sunday night before Tom Hagen could kiss his wife good-bye and drive out tothe airport. With his special number one priority (a grateful gift from a Pentagon staff generalofficer) he had no trouble getting on a plane to Los Angeles. It had been a busy but satisfying day for Tom Hagen. Genco Abbandando had died atthree in the morning and when Don Corleone returned from the hospital, he had informed Hagenthat he was now officially the new Consigliere to the family. This meant that Hagen was sure tobecome a very rich man, to say nothing of power. The Don had broken a long-standing tradition. The Consigliere was always afull-blooded Sicilian, and the fact that Hagen had been brought up as a member of the Don’sfamily made no difference to that tradition. It was a question of blood. Only a Sicilian born to theways of omerta, the law of silence, could be trusted in the key post of Consigliere. Between thehead of the family, Don Corleone, who dictated policy, and the operating level of men whoactually carried out the orders of the Don, there were three layers, or buffers. In that way nothingcould be traced to the top. Unless the Consigliere turned traitor. That Sunday morning DonCorleone gave explicit instructions on what should be done to the two young men who hadbeaten the daughter of Amerigo Bonasera. But he had given those orders in private to TomHagen. Later in the day Hagen had, also in private without witnesses, instructed Clemenza. In43turn Clemenza had told Paulie Gatto to execute the commission. Paulie Gatto would now musterthe necessary manpower and execute the orders. Paulie Gatto and his men would not know whythis particular task was being carried out or who had ordered it originally. Each link of the chainwould have to turn traitor for the Don to be involved and though it had never yet happened, therewas always the possibility. The cure for that possibility also was known. Only one link in thechain had to disappear. The Consigliere was also what his name implied. He was the counselor to the Don, hisright-hand man, his auxiliary brain. He was also his closest companion and his closest friend. Onimportant trips he would drive the Don’s car, at conferences he would go out and get the Donrefreshments, coffee and sandwiches, fresh cigars. He would know everything the Don knew ornearly everything, all the cells of power. He was the one man in the world who could bring theDon crashing down to destruction. But no Consigliere had ever betrayed a Don, not in thememory of any of the powerful Sicilian families who had established themselves in America.There was no future in it. And every Consigliere knew that if he kept the faith, he would becomerich, wield power and win respect. If misfortune came, his wife and children would be shelteredand cared for as if he were alive or free. If he kept the faith.In some matters the Consigliere had to act for his Don in a more open way and yet notinvolve his principal. Hagen was flying to California on just such a matter. He realized that hiscareer as Consigliere would be seriously affected by the success or failure of this mission. Byfamily business standards whether Johnny Fontane got his coveted part in the war movie, or didnot, was a minor matter. Far more important was the meeting Hagen had set up with VirgilSollozzo the following Friday. But Hagen knew that to the Don, both were of equal importance,which settled the matter for any good Consigliere.The piston plane shook Tom Hagen’s already nervous insides and he ordered a martinifrom the hostess to quiet them. Both the Don and Johnny had briefed him on the character of themovie producer, Jack Woltz. From everything that Johnny said, Hagen knew he would never beable to persuade Woltz. But he also had no doubt whatsoever that the Don would keep hispromise to Johnny. His own role was that of negotiator and contact. Lying back in his seat, Hagen went over all the information given to him that day. JackWoltz was one of the three most important movie producers in Hollywood, owner of his ownstudio with dozens of stars under contract. He was on the President of the United States’44Advisory Council for War Information, Cinematic Division, which meant simply that he helpedmake propaganda movies. He had had dinner at the White House. He had entertained J. EdgarHoover in his Hollywood home. But none of this was as impressive as it sounded. They were allofficial relationships. Woltz didn’t have any personal political power, mainly because he was anextreme reactionary, partly because he was a megalomaniac who loved to wield power wildlywithout regard to the fact that by so doing legions of enemies sprang up out of the ground. Hagen sighed. There would be no way to “handle” Jack Woltz. He opened his briefcaseand tried to get some paper work done, but he was too tired. He ordered another martini andreflected on his life. He had no regrets, indeed he felt that he had been extremely lucky.Whatever the reason, the course he had chosen ten years ago had proved to be right for him. Hewas successful, he was as happy as any grown man could reasonably expect, and he found lifeinteresting. Tom Hagen was thirty-five years old, a tall crew-cut man, very slender, veryordinary-looking. He was a lawyer but did not do the actual detailed legal work for the Corleonefamily business though he had practiced law for three years after passing the bar exam. At the age of eleven he had been a playmate of eleven-year-old Sonny Corleone. Hagen’smother had gone blind and then died during his eleventh year. Hagen’s father, a heavy drinker,had become a hopeless drunkard. A hardworking carpenter, he had never done a dishonest thingin his life. But his drinking destroyed his family and finally killed him. Tom Hagen was left anorphan who wandered the streets and slept in hallways. His younger sister had been put in afoster home, but in the 1920’s the social agencies did not follow up cases of eleven-year-oldboys who were so ungrateful as to run from their charity. Hagen, too, had an eye infection.Neighbors whispered that he had caught or inherited it from his mother and so therefore it couldbe caught from him. He was shunned. Sonny Corleone, a warmhearted and imperiouseleven-year-old, had brought his friend home and demanded that he be taken in. Tom Hagen wasgiven a hot dish of spaghetti with oily rich tomato sauce, the taste of which he had neverforgotten, and then given a metal folding bed to sleep on. In the most natural way, without a word being spoken or the matter discussed in anyfashion, Don Corleone had permitted the boy to stay in his household. Don Corleone himselftook the boy to a special doctor and had his eye infection cured. He sent him to college and lawschool. In all this the Don acted not as a father but rather as a guardian. There was no show of45affection but oddly enough the Don treated Hagen more courteously than his own sons, did notimpose a parental will upon him. It was the boy’s decision to go to law school after college. Hehad heard/Don Corleone say once, “ A lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundredmen with guns.” Meanwhile, much to the annoyance of their father, Sonny and Freddie insistedon going into the family business after graduation from high school. Only Michael had gone onto college, and he had enlisted in the Marines the day after Pearl Harbor. After he passed the bar exam, Hagen married to start his own family. The bride was ayoung Italian girl from New Jersey, rare at that time for being a college graduate. After thewedding, which was of course held in the home of Don Corleone, the Don offered to supportHagen in any undertaking he desired, to send him law clients; furnish his office, start him in realestate.. Tom Hagen had bowed his head and said to the Don, “I would like to work for you.” The Don was surprised, yet pleased. “You know who I am?” he asked. Hagen nodded. He hadn’t really known the extent of the Don’s power, not then. He didnot really know in the ten years that followed until he was made the acting Consigliere afterGenco Abbandando became ill. But he nodded and met the Don’s eyes with his own. “I wouldwork for you like your sons,” Hagen said, meaning with complete loyalty, with completeacceptance of the Don’s parental divinity. The Don, with that understanding which was eventhen building the legend of his greatness, showed the young man the first mark of fatherlyaffection since he had come into his household. He took Hagen into his arms for a quick embraceand afterward treated him more like a true son, though he would sometimes say, “Tom, neverforget your parents,” as if he were reminding himself as well as Hagen. There was no chance that Hagen would forget. His mother had been near moronic andslovenly, so ridden by anemia she could not feel affection for her children or make a pretense ofit. His father Hagen had hated. His mother’s blindness before she died had terrified him and hisown eye infection had been a stroke of doom. He had been sure he would go blind. When hisfather died, Tom Hagen’s eleven-year-old mind had snapped in a curious way. He had roamedthe streets like an animal waiting for death until the fateful day Sonny found him sleeping in theback of a hallway and brought him to his home. What had happened afterward was a miracle.But for years Hagen had had nightmares, dreaming he had grown to manhood blind, tapping awhite cane, his blind children behind him tap-tapping with their little white canes as they begged46in the streets. Some mornings when he woke the face of Don Corleone was imprinted on hisbrain in that first conscious moment and he would feel safe. But the Don had insisted that he put in three years of general law practice in addition tohis duties for the family business. This experience had proved invaluable later on, and alsoremoved any doubts in Hagen’s mind about working for Don Corleone. He had then spent twoyears of training in the offices of a top firm of criminal lawyers in which the Don had someinfluence. It was apparent to everyone that he had a flair for this branch of the law. He did welland when he went into the full-time service of the family business, Don Corleone had not beenable to reproach him once in the six years that followed. When he had been made the acting Consigliere, the other powerful Sicilian familiesreferred contemptuously to the Corleone family as the “Irish gang.” This had amused Hagen. Ithad also taught him that he could never hope to succeed the Don as the head of the familybusiness. But he was content. That had never been his goal, such an ambition would have been a“disrespect” to his benefactor and his benefactor’s blood family. It was still dark when the plane landed in Los Angeles. Hagen checked into his hotel,showered and shaved, and watched dawn come over the city. He ordered breakfast andnewspapers to be sent up to his room and relaxed until it was time for his ten A.M. appointmentwith Jack Woltz. The appointment had been surprisingly easy to make. The day before, Hagen had called the most powerful man in the movie labor unions, aman named Billy Goff. Acting on instructions from Don Corleone, Hagen had told Goff toarrange an appointment on the next day for Hagen to call on Jack Woltz, that he should hint toWoltz that if Hagen was not made happy by the results of the interview, there could be a laborstrike at the movie studio. An hour later Hagen received a call from Goff. The appointmentwould be at ten A.M. Woltz had gotten the message about the possible labor strike but hadn’tseemed too impressed, Goff said. He added, “If it really comes down to that, I gotta talk to theDon myself.” “If it comes to that he’ll talk to you,” Hagen said. By saying this he avoided making anypromises. He was not surprised that Goff was so agreeable to the Don’s wishes. The familyempire, technically, did not extend beyond the New York area but Don Corleone had firstbecome strong by helping labor leaders. Many of them still owed him debts of friendship.47 But the ten A.M. appointment was a bad sign. It meant that he would be first on theappointment list, that he would not be invited to lunch. It meant that Woltz held him in smallworth. Goff had not been threatening enough, probably because Woltz had him on his graftpayroll. And sometimes the Don’s success in keeping himself out of the limelight worked to thedisadvantage of the family business, in that his name did not mean anything to outside circles. His analysis proved correct. Woltz kept him waiting for a half hour past the appointedtime. Hagen didn’t mind. The reception room was very plush, very comfortable, and on aplum-colored couch opposite him sat the most beautiful child Hagen had ever seen. She was nomore than eleven or twelve, dressed in a very expensive but simple way as a grown woman. Shebad incredibly golden hair, huge deep sea-blue eyes and a fresh raspberry-red mouth. She wasguarded by a woman obviously her mother, who tried to stare Hagen down with a cold arrogancethat made him want to punch her in the face. The angel child and the dragon mother, Hagenthought, returning the mother’s cold stare. Finally an exquisitely dressed but stout middle-aged woman came to lead him through astring of offices to the office-apartment of the movie producer. Hagen was impressed by thebeauty of the offices and the people working in them. He smiled. They were all shrewdies, tryingto get their foot in the movie door by taking office jobs, and most of them would work in theseoffices for the rest of their lives or until they accepted defeat and returned to their home towns. Jack Woltz was a tall, powerfully built man with a heavy paunch almost concealed by hisperfectly tailored suit. Hagen knew his history. At ten years of age Woltz had hustled empty beerkegs and pushcarts on the East Side. At twenty he helped his father sweat garment workers. Atthirty he had left New York and moved West, invested in the nickelodeon and pioneered motionpictures. At forty-eight he had been the most powerful movie magnate in Hollywood, stillrough-spoken, rapaciously amorous, a raging wolf ravaging helpless flocks of young starlets. Atfifty he transformed himself. He took speech lessons, learned how to dress from an English valetand how to behave socially from an English butler. When his first wife died he married aworld-famous and beautiful actress who didn’t like acting. Now at the age of sixty he collectedold master paintings, was a member of the President’s Advisory Committee, and had set up amultimillion-dollar foundation in his name to promote art in motion pictures. His daughter hadmarried an English lord, his son an Italian princess. His latest passion, as reported dutifully by every movie columnist in America, was his48own racing stables on which he had spent ten million dollars in the past year. He had madeheadlines by purchasing the famed English racing horse Khartoum for the incredible price of sixhundred thousand dollars and then announcing that the undefeated racer would be retired and putto stud exclusively for the Woltz stables. He received Hagen courteously, his beautifully, evenly tanned, meticulously barberedface contorted with a grimace meant to be a smile. Despite all the money spent, despite theministrations of the most knowledgeable technicians, his age showed; the flesh of his face lookedas if it had been seamed together. But there was an enormous vitality in his movements and hehad what Don Corleone had, the air of a man who commanded absolutely the world in which helived. Hagen came directly to the point. That he was an emissary from a friend of JohnnyFontane. That this friend was a very powerful man who would pledge his gratitude and undyingfriendship to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz would grant a small favor. The small favor would be thecasting of Johnny Fontane in the new war movie the studio planned to start next week. The seamed face was impassive, polite. “What favors can your friend do me?” Woltzasked. There was just a trace of condescension in his voice. Hagen ignored the condescension. He explained. “You’ve got some labor trouble comingup. My friend can absolutely guarantee to make that trouble disappear. You have a top male starwho makes a lot of money for your studio but he just graduated from marijuana to heroin. Myfriend will guarantee that your male star won’t be able to get any more heroin. And if some otherlittle things come up over the years a phone call to me can solve your problems.” Jack Woltz listened to this as if he were hearing the boasting of a child. Then he saidharshly, his voice deliberately all East Side, “You trying to put muscle on me?” Hagen said coolly, “ Absolutely not. I’ve come to ask a service for a friend. I’ve tried toexplain that you won’t lose anything by it.” Almost as if he willed it, Woltz made his face a mask of anger. The mouth curled, hisheavy brows, dyed black, contracted to form a thick line over his glinting eyes. He leaned overthe desk toward Hagen.” All right, you smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you andyour boss, whoever he is. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. I don’t care how many guineaMafia goombahs come out of the woodwork.” He leaned back. “A word of advice to you, myfriend. J. Edgar Hoover, I assume you’ve heard of him”--Woltz smiled sardonically--”is a49personal friend of mine. If I let him know I’m being pressured, you guys will never know whathit you.” Hagen listened patiently. He had expected better from a man of Woltz’s stature. Was itpossible that a man who acted this stupidly could rise to the head of a company worth hundredsof millions? That was something to think about since the Don was looking for new things to putmoney into, and if the top brains of this industry were so dumb, movies might be the thing. Theabuse itself bothered him not at all. Hagen had learned the art of negotiation from the Donhimself. “Never get angry,” the Don had instructed. “Never make a threat. Reason with people.”The word “reason” sounded so much better in Italian, ragione, to rejoin. The art of this was toignore all insults, all threats; to turn the other cheek. Hagen had seen the Don sit at a negotiatingtable for eight hours, swallowing insults, trying to persuade a notorious and megalomaniacstrong-arm man to mend his ways. At the end of the eight hours Don Corleone had thrown up hishands in a helpless gesture and said to the other men at the table, “But no one can reason withthis fellow,” and had stalked out of the meeting room. The strong-arm man had turned white withfear. Emissaries were sent to bring the Don back into the room. An agreement was reached buttwo months later the strong-arm was shot to death in his favorite barbershop. So Hagen started again, speaking in the most ordinary voice. “Look at my card,” he said.“I’m a lawyer. Would I stick my neck out? Have I uttered one threatening word? Let me just saythat I am prepared to meet any condition you name to get Johnny Fontane that movie. I thinkI’ve already offered a great deal for such a small favor. A favor that I understand it would be inyour interest to grant. Johnny tells me that you admit he would be perfect for that part. And letme say that this favor would never be asked if that were not so. In fact, if you’re worried aboutyour investment, my client would finance the picture. But please let me make myself absolutelyclear. We understand your no is no. Nobody can force you or is trying to. We know about yourfriendship with Mr. Hoover, I may add, and my boss respects you for it. He respects thatrelationship very much.” Woltz had been doodling with a huge, red-feathered pen. At the mention of money hisinterest was aroused and he stopped doodling. He said patronizingly, “This picture is budgeted atfive million.” Hagen whistled softly to show that he was impressed. Then he said very casually, “Myboss has a lot of friends who back his judgment.”50 For the first time Woltz seemed to take the whole thing seriously. He studied Hagen’scard. “I never heard of you,” he said. “I know most of the big lawyers in New York, but just whothe hell are you?” “I have one of those dignified corporate practices,” Hagen said dryly. “I just handle thisone account.” He rose. “I won’t take up any more of your time.” He held out his hand, Woltzshook it. Hagen took a few steps toward the door and turned to face Woltz again. “I understandyou have to deal with a lot of people who try to seem more important than they are. In my casethe reverse is true. Why don’t you check me out with our mutual friend? If you reconsider, callme at my hotel.” He paused. “This may be sacrilege to you, but my client can do things for youthat even Mr. Hoover might find out of his range.” He saw the movie producer’s eyes narrowing.Woltz was finally getting the message. “By the way, I admire your pictures very much,” Hagensaid in the most fawning voice he could manage. “I hope you can keep up the good work. Ourcountry needs it; “ Late that afternoon Hagen received a call from the producer’s secretary that a car wouldpick him up within the hour to take him out to Mr. Woltz’s country home for dinner. She toldhim it would be about a three-hour drive but that the car was equipped with a bar and some horsd’oeuvres. Hagen knew that Woltz made the trip in his private plane and wondered why hehadn’t been invited to make the trip by air. The secretary’s voice was adding politely, “Mr.Woltz suggested you bring an overnight bag and he’ll get you to the airport in the morning.” “I’ll do that,” Hagen said. That was another thing to wonder about. How did Woltz knowhe was taking the morning plane back to New York? He thought about it for a moment. The mostlikely explanation was that Woltz had set private detectives on his trail to get all possibleinformation. Then Woltz certainly knew he represented the Don, which meant that he knewsomething about the Don, which in turn meant that he was now ready to take the whole matterseriously. Something might be done after all, Hagen thought. And maybe Woltz was smarterthan he had appeared this morning. The home of Jack Woltz looked like an implausible movie set. There was aplantation-type mansion, huge grounds girdled by a rich black-dirt bridle path, stables andpasture for a herd of horses. The hedges, flower beds and grasses were as carefully manicured asa movie star’s nails.  Woltz greeted Hagen on a glass-paneled air-conditioned porch. The producer wasinformally dressed in blue silk shirt open at the neck, mustard-colored slacks, soft leather sandals.Framed in all this color and rich fabric his seamed, tough face was startling. He handed Hagen anoutsized martini glass and took one for himself from the prepared tray. He seemed more friendlythan he had been earlier in the day. He put his arm over Hagen’s shoulder and said, “We have alittle time before dinner, let’s go look at my horses.” As they walked toward the stables he said,“I checked you out, Tom; you should have told me your boss is Corleone. I thought you werejust some third-rate hustler Johnny was running in to bluff me. And I don’t bluff. Not that I wantto make enemies, I never believed in that. But let’s just enjoy ourselves now. We can talkbusiness after dinner.” Surprisingly Woltz proved to be a truly considerate host. He explained his new methods,innovations that he hoped would make his stable the most successful in America. The stableswere all fire-proofed, sanitized to the highest degree, and guarded by a special security detail ofprivate detectives. Finally Woltz led him to a stall which had a huge bronze plaque attached to itsoutside wall. On the plaque was the name “Khartoum.” The horse inside the stall was, even to Hagen’s inexperienced eyes, a beautiful animal.Khartoum’s skin was jet black except for a diamond-shaped white patch on his huge forehead.The great brown eyes glinted like golden apples, the black skin over the taut body was silk.Woltz said with childish pride, “The greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in England lastyear for six hundred grand. I bet even the Russian Czars never paid that much for a single horse.But I’m not going to race him, I’m going to put him to stud. I’m going to build the greatestracing stable this country has ever known.” He stroked the horse’s mane and called out softly,“Khartoum, Khartoum.” There was real love in his voice and the animal responded. Woltz saidto Hagen, “I’m a good horseman, you know, and the first time I ever rode I was fifty years old.”He laughed. “Maybe one of my grandmothers in Russia got raped by a Cossack and I got hisblood.” He tickled Khartoum’s belly and said with sincere admiration, “Look at that cock on him.I should have such a cock.” They went back to the mansion to have dinner. It was served by three waiters under thecommand of a butler, the table linen and ware were all gold thread and silver, but Hagen foundthe food mediocre. Woltz obviously lived alone, and just as obviously was not a man who caredabout food. Hagen waited until they had both lit up huge Havana cigars before he asked Woltz,52“Does Johnny get it or not?” “I can’t,” Woltz said. “I can’t put Johnny into that picture even if I wanted to. Thecontracts are all signed for all the performers and the cameras roll next week. There’s no way Ican swing it.” Hagen said impatiently, “Mr. Woltz, the big advantage of dealing with a man at the top isthat such an excuse is not valid. You can do anything you want to do.” He puffed on his cigar.“Don’t you believe my client can keep his promises?” Woltz said dryly, “I believe that I’m going to have labor trouble. Goff called me up onthat, the son of a bitch, and the way he talked to me you’d never guess I pay him a hundred granda year under the table. And I believe you can get that fag he-man star of mine off heroin. But Idon’t care about that and I can finance my own pictures. Because I hate that bastard Fontane.Tell your boss this is one favor I can’t give but that he should try me again on anything else.Anything at all.” Hagen thought, you sneaky bastard, then why the hell did you bring me all the way outhere? The producer had something on his mind. Hagen said coldly, “I don’t think you understandthe situation. Mr. Corleone is Johnny Fontane’s godfather. That is a very close, a very sacredreligious relationship.” Woltz bowed his head in respect at this reference to religion. Hagen wenton. “Italians have a little joke, that the world is so hard a man must have two fathers to look afterhim, and that’s why they have godfathers. Since Johnny’s father died, Mr. Corleone feels hisresponsibility even more deeply. As for trying you again, Mr. Corleone is much too sensitive. Henever asks a second favor where he has been refused the first.” Woltz shrugged. “I’m sorry. The answer is still no. But since you’re here, what will itcost me to have that labor trouble cleared up? In cash. Right now.” That solved one puzzle for Hagen. Why Woltz was putting in so much time on him whenhe had already decided not to give Johnny the part. And that could not be changed at thismeeting. Woltz felt secure; he was not afraid of the power of Don Corleone. And certainly Woltzwith his national political connections, his acquaintanceship with the FBI chief, his hugepersonal fortune and his absolute power in the film industry, could not feel threatened by DonCorleone. To any intelligent man, even to Hagen, it seemed that Woltz had correctly assessed hisposition. He was impregnable to the Don if he was willing to take the losses the labor strugglewould cost. There was only one thing wrong with the whole equation. Don Corleone had53promised his godson he would get the part and Don Corleone had never, to Hagen’s knowledge,broken his word in such matters. Hagen said quietly, “You are deliberately misunderstanding me. You are trying to makeme an accomplice to extortion. Mr. Corleone promises only to speak in your favor on this labortrouble as a matter of friendship in return for your speaking in behalf of his client. A friendlyexchange. of influence, nothing more. But I can see you don’t take me seriously. Personally, Ithink that is a mistake.” Woltz, as if he had been waiting for such a moment, let himself get angry. “I understoodperfectly,” he said. “That’s the Mafia style, isn’t is? All olive oil and sweet talk when whatyou’re really doing is/making threats. So let me lay it on the line. Johnny Fontane will never getthat part and he’s perfect for it. It would make him a great star. But he never will be because Ihate that pinko punk and I’m going to run him out of the movies. And I’ll tell you why. Heruined one of my most valuable protégées. For five years I had this girl under training, singing,dancing, acting lessons, I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was going to make her a star.I’ll be even more frank, just to show you that I’m not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn’t alldollars and cents. That girl was beautiful and she was the greatest piece of ass I’ve ever had andI’ve had them allover the world. She could suck you out like a water pump. Then Johnny comesalong with that olive-oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off. She threw it all away just tomake me ridiculous. A man in my position, Mr. Hagen, can’t afford to look ridiculous. I have topay Johnny off.” For the first time, Woltz succeeded in astounding Hagen. He found it inconceivable that agrown man of substance would let such trivialities affect his judgment in an affair of business,and one of such importance. In Hagen’s world, the Corleones’ world, the physical beauty, thesexual power of women, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters. It was a privateaffair, except, of course, in matters of marriage and family disgrace. Hagen decided to make onelast try. “You are absolutely right, Mr. Woltz,” Hagen said. “But are your grievances that major?I don’t think you’ve understood how important this very small favor is to my client. Mr.Corleone held the infant Johnny in his arms when he was baptized. When Johnny’s father died,Mr. Corleone assumed the duties of parenthood, indeed he is called ‘Godfather’ by many, manypeople who wish to show their respect and gratitude for the help he has given them. Mr.54Corleone never lets his friends down.” Woltz stood up abruptly. “I’ve listened to about enough. Thugs don’t give me orders, Igive them orders. If I pick up this phone, you’ll spend the night in jail. And if that Mafiagoombah tries any rough stuff, he’ll find out I’m not a band leader. Yeah, I heard that story too.Listen, your Mr. Corleone will never know what hit him. Even if I have to use my influence atthe White House.” The stupid, stupid son of a bitch. How the hell did he get to be a pezzonovante, Hagenwondered. Advisor to the President, head of the biggest movie studio in the world. Definitely theDon should get into the movie business. And the guy was taking his words at their sentimentalface value. He was not getting the message. “Thank you for the dinner and a pleasant evening,” Hagen said. “Could you give metransportation to the airport? I don’t think I’ll spend the night.” He smiled coldly at Woltz. “Mr.Corleone is a man who insists on hearing bad news at once.” While waiting in the floodlit colonnade of the mansion for his car, Hagen saw twowomen about to enter a long limousine already parked in the driveway. They were the beautifultwelve-year-old blond girl and her mother he had seen in Woltz’s office that morning. But nowthe girl’s exquisitely cut mouth seemed to have smeared into a thick, pink mass. Her sea-blueeyes were filmed over and when she walked down the steps toward the open car her long legstottered like a crippled foal’s. Her mother supported the child, helping her into the car, hissingcommands into her ear. The mother’s head turned for a quick furtive look at Hagen and he sawin her eyes a burning, hawk-like triumph. Then she too disappeared into the limousine. So that was why he hadn’t got the plane ride from Los Angeles, Hagen thought. The girland her mother had made the trip with the movie producer. That had given Woltz enough time torelax before dinner and do the job on the little kid. And Johnny wanted to live in this world?Good luck to him, and good luck to Woltz. Paulie Gatto hated quickie jobs, especially when they involved violence. He liked to planthings ahead. And something like tonight, even though it was punk stuff, could turn into seriousbusiness if somebody made a mistake. Now, sipping his beer, he glanced around, checking howthe two young punks were making out with the two little tramps at the bar. Paulie Gatto knew everything there was to know about those two punks. Their names55were Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan. They were both about twenty years old, good-looking,brown-haired, tall, well-built. Both were due to go back to college out of town in two weeks,both had fathers with political influence and this, with their college student classification, had sofar kept them out of the draft. They were both also under suspended sentences for assaulting thedaughter of Amerigo Bonasera. The lousy bastards, Paulie Gatto thought. Draft dodging,violating their probation by drinking in a bar after midnight, chasing floozies. Young punks.Paulie Gatto had been deferred from the draft himself because his doctor had furnished the draftboard with documents showing that this patient, male, white, aged twenty-six, unmarried, hadreceived electrical shock treatments for a mental condition. All false, of course, but Paulie Gattofelt that he had earned his draft exemption. It had been arranged by Clemenza after Gatto had“made his bones” in the family business. It was Clemenza who had told him that this job must be rushed through, before the boyswent to college. Why the hell did it have to be done in New York, Gatto wondered. Clemenzawas always giving extra orders instead of just giving out the job. Now if those two little trampswalked out with the punks it would be another night wasted. He could hear one of the girls laughing and saying, “ Are you crazy, Jerry? I’m not goingin any car with you. I don’t want to wind up in the hospital like that other poor girl.” Her voicewas spitefully rich with satisfaction. That was enough for Gat to. He finished up his beer andwalked out into the dark street. Perfect. It was after midnight. There was only one other bar thatshowed light. The rest of the stores were closed. The precinct patrol car had been taken care ofby Clemenza. They wouldn’t be around that way until they got a radio call and then they’d comeslow. He leaned against the four-door Chevy sedan. In the back seat two men were sitting,almost invisible, although they were very big men. Paulie said, “Take them when they comeout.” He still thought it had all been set up too fast. Clemenza had given him copies of thepolice mug shots of the two punks, the dope on where the punks went drinking every night topick up bar girls. Paulie had recruited two of the strong-arms in the family and fingered thepunks for them. He had also given them their instructions. No blows on the top or the back of thehead, there was to be no accidental fatality. Other than that they could go as far as they liked. Hehad given them only one warning: “If those punks get out of the hospital in less than a month,56you guys go back to driving trucks.” The two big men were getting out of the car. They were both ex-boxers who had nevermade it past the small clubs and had been fixed up by Sonny Corleone with a little loansharkaction so that they could make a decent living. They were, naturally, anxious to show theirgratitude. When Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonan came out of the bar they were perfect setups. Thebar girl’s taunts had left their adolescent vanity prickly. Paulie Gat to, leaning against the fenderof his car, called out to them with a teasing laugh, “Hey, Casanova, those broads really brushedyou off.” The two young men turned on him with delight. Paulie Gatto looked like a perfect outletfor their humiliation. Ferret-faced, short, slightly built and a wise guy in the bargain. Theypounced on him eagerly and immediately found their arms pinned by two men grabbing themfrom behind. At the same moment Paulie Gatto had slipped onto his right hand a specially madeset of brass knuckles studded with one-sixteenth-inch iron spikes. His timing was good, heworked out in the gym three times a week. He smashed the punk named Wagner right on thenose. The man holding Wagner lifted him up off the ground and Paulie swung his arm,uppercutting into the perfectly positioned groin. Wagner went limp and the big man dropped him.This had taken no more than six seconds. Now both of them turned their attention to Kevin Moonan, who was trying to shout. Theman holding him from behind did so easily with one huge muscled arm. The other hand he putaround Moonan’s throat to cut off any sound. Paulie Gatto jumped into the car and started the motor. The two big men were beatingMoonan to jelly. They did so with frightening deliberation, as if they had all the time in theworld. They did not throw punches in flurries but in timed, slow-motion sequences that carriedthe full weight of their massive bodies. Each blow landed with a splat of flesh splitting open.Gatto got a glimpse of Moonan’s face. It was unrecognizable. The two men left Moonan lying onthe sidewalk and turned their attention to Wagner. Wagner was trying to get to his feet and hestarted to scream for help. Someone came out of the bar and the two men had to work faster now.They clubbed Wagner to his knees. One of the men took his arm and twisted it, then kicked himin the spine. There was a cracking sound and Wagner’s scream of agony brought windows openall along the street. The two men worked very quickly. One of them held Wagner up by using his57two hands around Wagner’s head like a vise. The other man smashed his huge fist into the fixedtarget. There were more people coming out of the bar but none tried to interfere. Paulie Gattoyelled, “Come on, enough.” The two big men jumped into the car and Paulie gunned it away,Somebody would describe the car and read the license plates but it didn’t matter. It was a stolenCalifornia plate and there were one hundred thousand black Chevy sedans in New York City.Chapter 2 Tom Hagen went to his law office in the city on Thursday morning. He planned to catchup on his paper work so as to have everything cleared away for the meeting with Virgil Sollozzoon Friday. A meeting of such importance that he had asked the Don for a full evening of talk toprepare for the proposition they knew Sollozzo would offer the family business. Hagen wantedto have all little details cleared away so that he could go to that preparatory meeting with anunencumbered mind. The Don had not seemed surprised when Hagen returned from California late Tuesdayevening and told him the results of the negotiations with Woltz. He had made Hagen go overevery detail and grimaced with distaste when Hagen told about the beautiful little girl and hermother. He had murmured “infamita, “ his strongest disapproval. He had asked Hagen one finalquestion. “Does this man have real balls?” Hagen considered exactly what the Don meant by this question. Over the years he hadlearned that the Don’s values were so different from those of most people that his words alsocould have a different meaning. Did Woltz have character? Did he have a strong will? He mostcertainly did, but that was not what the Don was asking. Did the movie producer have thecourage not to be bluffed? Did he have the willingness to suffer heavy financial loss delay on hismovies would mean, the scandal of his big star exposed as a user of heroin? Again the answerwas yes. But again this was not what the Don meant. Finally Hagen translated the questionproperly in his mind. Did Jack Woltz have the balls to risk everything, to run the chance oflosing all on a matter of principle, on a matter of honor; for revenge? Hagen smiled. He did it rarely but now he could not resist jesting with the Don. “You’reasking if he is a Sicilian.” The Don nodded his head pleasantly, acknowledging the flatteringwitticism and its truth. “No,” Hagen said.58 That had been all. The Don had pondered the question until the next day. On Wednesdayafternoon he had called Hagen to his home and given him his instructions. The instructions hadconsumed the rest of Hagen’s working day and left him dazed with admiration. There was noquestion in his mind that the Don had solved the problem, that Woltz would call him thismorning with the news that Johnny Fontane had the starring part in his new war movie. At that moment the phone did ring but it was Amerigo Bonasera. The undertaker’s voicewas trembling with gratitude. He wanted Hagen to convey to the Don his undying friendship.The Don had only to call on him. He, Amerigo Bonasera, would lay down his life for the blessedGodfather. Hagen assured him that the Don would be told. The Daily News had carried a middle-page spread of Jerry Wagner and Kevin Moonanlying in the street. The photos were expertly gruesome, they seemed to be pulps of human beings.Miraculously, said the News, they were both still alive though they would both be in the hospitalfor months and would require plastic surgery. Hagen made a note to tell Clemenza thatsomething should be done for Paulie Gat to. He seemed to know his job. Hagen worked quickly and efficiently for the next three hours consolidating earningreports from the Don’s real estate company, his olive oil importing business and his constructionfirm. None of them were doing well but with the war over they should all become rich producers.He had almost forgotten the Johnny Fontane problem when his secretary told him California wascalling. He felt a little thrill of anticipation as he picked up the phone and said, “Hagen here.” The voice that came over the phone was unrecognizable with hate and passion. “Youfucking bastard,” Woltz screamed. “I’ll have you all in jail for a hundred years. I’ll spend everypenny I have to get you. I’ll get that Johnny Fontane’s balls cut off, do you hear me, you guineatuck?” Hagen said kindly, “I’m German-Irish.” There was a long pause and then a click of thephone being hung up. Hagen smiled. Not once had Woltz uttered a threat against Don Corleonehimself. Genius had its rewards. Jack Woltz always slept alone. He had a bed big enough for ten people and a bedroomlarge enough for a movie ballroom scene, but he had slept alone since the death of his first wifeten years before. This did not mean he no longer used women. He was physically a vigorous mandespite his age, but he could be aroused now only by very young girls and had learned that a few59hours in the evening were all the youth his body and his patience could tolerate. On this Thursday morning, for some reason, he awoke early. The light of dawn made hishuge bedroom as misty as a foggy meadowland. Far down at the foot of his bed was a familiarshape and Woltz struggled up on his elbows to get a clearer look. It had the shape of a horse’shead. Still groggy, Woltz reached and flicked on the night table lamp. The shock of what he saw made him physically ill. It seemed as if a great sledgehammerhad struck him on the chest, his heartbeat jumped erratically and he became nauseous. His vomitspluttered on the thick bear rug. Severed from its body, the black silky head of the great horse Khartoum was stuck fast ina thick cake of blood. White, reedy tendons showed. Froth covered the muzzle and thoseapple-sized eyes that had glinted like gold, were mottled the color of rotting fruit with dead,hemorrhaged blood. Woltz was struck by a purely animal terror and out of that terror hescreamed for his servants and out of that terror he called Hagen to make his uncontrolled threats.His maniacal raving alarmed the butler, who called Woltz’s personal physician and his second incommand at the studio. But Woltz regained his senses before they arrived. He had been profoundly shocked. What kind of man could destroy an animal worth sixhundred thousand dollars? Without a word of warning. Without any negotiation to have the act,its order, countermanded. The ruthlessness, the sheer disregard for any values, implied a manwho considered himself completely his own law, even his own God. And a man who backed upthis kind of will with the power and cunning that held his own stable security force of no account.For by this time Woltz had learned that the horse’s body had obviously been heavily druggedbefore someone leisurely hacked the huge triangular head off with an ax. The men on night dutyclaimed that they had heard nothing. To Woltz this seemed impossible. They could be made totalk. They had been bought off and they could be made to tell who had done the buying. Woltz was not a stupid man, he was merely a supremely egotistical one. He had mistakenthe power he wielded in his world to be more potent than the power of Don Corleone. He hadmerely needed some proof that this was not true. He understood this message. That despite all hiswealth, despite all his contacts with the President of the United States, despite all his claims offriendship with the director of the FBI, an obscure importer of Italian olive oil would have himkilled. Would actually have him killed! Because he wouldn’t give Johnny Fontane a movie parthe wanted. It was incredible. People didn’t have any right to act that way. There couldn’t be any60kind of world if people acted that way. It was insane. It meant you couldn’t do what you wantedwith your own money, with the companies you owned, the power you had to give orders. It wasten times worse than communism. It had to be smashed. It must never be allowed. Woltz let the doctor give him a very mild sedation. It helped him calm down again and tothink sensibly. What really shocked him was the casualness with which this man Corleone hadordered the destruction of a world-famous horse worth six hundred thousand dollars. Six hundredthousand dollars! And that was just for openers. Woltz shuddered. He thought of this life he hadbuilt up. He was rich. He could have the most beautiful women in the world by crooking hisfinger and promising a contract. He was received by kings and queens. He lived a life as perfectas money and power could make it. It was crazy to risk all this because of a whim. Maybe hecould get to Corleone. What was the legal penalty for killing a racehorse? He laughed wildly andhis doctor and servants watched him with nervous anxiety. Another thought occurred to him. Hewould be the laughingstock of California merely because someone had contemptuously defiedhis power in such arrogant fashion. That decided him. That and the thought that maybe, maybethey wouldn’t kill him. That they had something much more clever and painful in reserve. Woltz gave the necessary orders. His personal confidential staff swung into action. Theservants and the doctor were sworn to secrecy on pain of incurring the studio’s and Woltz’sundying enmity. Word was given to the press that the racehorse Khartoum had died of an illnesscontracted during his shipment from England. Orders were given to bury the remains in a secretplace on the estate. Six hours later Johnny Fontane received a phone call from the executive producer of thefilm telling him to report for work the following Monday. That evening, Hagen went to the Don’s house to prepare him for the important meetingthe next day with Virgil Sollozzo. The Don had summoned his eldest son to attend, and SonnyCorleone, his heavy Cupid-shaped face drawn with fatigue, was sipping at a glass of water. Hemust still be humping that maid of honor, Hagen thought. Another worry. Don Corleone settled into an armchair puffing his Di Nobili cigar. Hagen kept a box ofthem in his room. He had tried to get the Don to switch to Havanas but the Don claimed theyhurt his throat. “Do we know everything necessary for us to know?” the Don asked.61 Hagen opened the folder that held his notes. The notes were in no way incriminating,merely cryptic reminders to make sure he touched on every important detail. “Sollozzo is comingto us for help,” Hagen said. “He will ask the family to put up at least a million dollars and topromise some sort of immunity from the law. For that we get a piece of the action, nobodyknows how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family and they may have a piece ofthe action. The action is narcotics. Sollozzo has the contacts in Turkey, where they grow thepoppy. From there he ships to Sicily. No trouble. In Sicily he has the plant to process into heroin.He has safety-valve operations to bring it down to morphine and bring it up to heroin ifnecessary. But it would seem that the processing plant in Sicily is protected in every way. Theonly hitch is bringing it into this country, and then distribution. Also initial capital. A milliondollars cash doesn’t grow on trees.” Hagen saw Don Corleone grimace. The old man hatedunnecessary flourishes in business matters. He went on hastily. “They call Sollozzo the Turk. Two reasons. He’s spent a lot of time in Turkey and issupposed to have a Turkish wife and kids. Second. He’s supposed to be very quick with the knife,of was, when he was young. Only in matters of business, though, and with some sort ofreasonable complaint. A very competent man and his own boss. He has a record, he’s done twoterms in prison, one in Italy, one in the United States, and he’s known to the authorities as anarcotics man. This could be a plus for us. It means that he’ll never get immunity to testify, sincehe’s considered the top and, of course, because of his record. Also he has an American wife andthree children and he is a good family man. He’ll stand still for any rap as long as he knows thatthey will be well taken care of for living money.” The Don puffed on his cigar and said, “Santino, what do you think?” Hagen knew what Sonny would say. Sonny was chafing at being under the Don’s thumb.He wanted a big operation of his own. Something like this would be perfect. Sonny took a long slug of scotch. “There’s a lot of money in that white powder,” he said.“But it could be dangerous. Some people could wind up in jail for twenty years. I’d say that if wekept out of the operations end, just stuck to protection and financing, it might be a good idea.” Hagen looked at Sonny approvingly. He had played his cards well. He had stuck to theobvious, much the best course for him. The Don puffed on his cigar. “And you, Tom, what do you think?” Hagen composed himself to be absolutely honest. He had already come to the conclusion62that the Don would refuse Sollozzo’s proposition. But what was worse, Hagen was convincedthat for one of the few times in his experience, the Don had not thought things through. He wasnot looking far enough ahead. “Go ahead, Tom,” the Don said encouragingly. “Not even a Sicilian Consigliere alwaysagrees with the boss.” They all laughed. “I think you should say yes,” Hagen said. “You know all the obvious reasons. But themost important one is this. There is more money potential in narcotics than in any other business.If we don’t get into it, somebody else will, maybe the Tattaglia family. With the revenue theyearn they can amass more and more police and political power. Their family will becomestronger than ours. Eventually they will come after us to take away what we have. It’s just likecountries. If they arm, we have to arm. If they become stronger economically, they become athreat to us. Now we have the gambling and we have the unions and right now they are the bestthings to have. But I think narcotics is the coming thing. I think we have to have a piece of thataction or we risk everything we have. Not now, but maybe ten years from now.” The Don seemed enormously impressed. He puffed on his cigar and murmured, “That’sthe most important thing of course.” He sighed and got to his feet. “What time do I have to meetthis infidel tomorrow?” Hagen said hopefully, “He’ll be here at ten in the morning.” Maybe the Don would go forit. “I’ll want you both here with me,” the Don said. He rose, stretching, and took his son bythe arm. “Santino, get some sleep tonight, you look like the devil himself. Take care of yourself,you won’t be young forever.” Sonny, encouraged by this sign of fatherly concern, asked the question Hagen did notdare to ask. “Pop, what’s your answer going to be?” Don Corleone smiled. “How do I know until I hear the percentages and other details?Besides I have to have time to think over the advice given here tonight. After all, I’m not a manwho does things rashly.” As he went out the door he said casually to Hagen, “Do you have inyour notes that the Turk made his living from prostitution before the war? As the Tattagliafamily does now. Write that down before you forget.” There was just a touch of derision in theDon’s voice and Hagen flushed. He had deliberately not mentioned it, legitimately so since itreally had no bearing, but he had feared it might prejudice the Don’s decision. He was63notoriously straitlaced in matters of sex. Virgil “the Turk” Sollozzo was a powerfully built, medium-sized man of darkcomplexion who could have been taken for a true Turk. He had a scimitar of a nose and cruelblack eyes. He also had an impressive dignity. Sonny Corleone met him at the door and brought him into the office where Hagen and theDon waited. Hagen thought he had never seen a more dangerous-looking man except for LucaBrasi. There were polite handshakings all around. If the Don ever asks me if this man has balls,I would have to answer yes, Hagen thought. He had never seen such force in one man, not eventhe Don. In fact the Don appeared at his worst. He was being a little too simple, a little toopeasantlike in his greeting. Sollozzo came to the point immediately. The business was narcotics. Everything was setup. Certain poppy fields in Turkey had pledged him certain amounts every year. He had aprotected plant in France to convert into morphine. He had an absolutely secure plant in Sicily toprocess into heroin. Smuggling into both countries was as positively safe as such matters couldbe. Entry into the United States would entail about five percent losses since the FBI itself wasincorruptible, as they both knew. But the profits would be enormous, the risk nonexistent. “Then why do you come to me?” the Don asked politely. “How have I deserved yourgenerosity?” Sollozzo’s dark face remained impassive. “I need two million dollars cash,” he said.“Equally important, I need a man who has powerful friends in the important places. Some of mycouriers will be caught over the years. That is inevitable. They will all have clean records, that Ipromise. So it will be logical for judges to give light sentences. I need a friend who canguarantee that when my people get in trouble they won’t spend more than a year or two in jail.Then they won’t talk. But if they get ten and twenty years, who knows? In this world there aremany weak individuals. They may talk, they may jeopardize more important people. Legalprotection is a must. I hear, Don Corleone, that you have as many judges in your pocket as abootblack has pieces of silver.” Don Corleone didn’t bother to acknowledge the compliment. “What percentage for myfamily?” he asked.64 Sollozzo’s eyes gleamed. “Fifty percent.” He paused and then said in a voice that wasalmost a caress, “In the first year your share would be three or four million dollars. Then it wouldgo up.” Don Corleone said, “ And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?” For the first time Sollozzo seemed to be nervous. “They will receive something from myshare. I need some help in the operations.” “So,” Don Corleone said, “I receive fifty percent merely for finance and legal protection.I have no worries about operations, is that what you tell me?” Sollozzo nodded. “If you think two million dollars in cash is ‘merely finance,’ Icongratulate you, Don Corleone.” The Don said quietly, “I consented to see you out of my respect for the Tattaglias andbecause I’ve heard you are a serious man to be treated also with respect. I must say no to you butI must give you my reasons. The profits in your business are huge but so are the risks. Youroperation, if I were part of it, could damage my other interests. It’s true I have many, manyfriends in politics, but they would not be so friendly if my business were narcotics instead ofgambling. They think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice, and they thinknarcotics a dirty business. No, don’t protest. I’m telling you their thoughts, not mine. How a manmakes his living is not my concern. And what I am telling you is that this business of yours is toorisky. All the members of my family have lived well the last ten years, without danger, withoutharm. I can’t endanger them or their livelihoods out of greed.” The only sign of Sollozzo’s disappointment was a quick flickering of his eyes around theroom, as if he hoped Hagen or Sonny would speak in his support. Then he said, “ Are youworried about security for your two million?” The Don smiled coldly. “No,” he said. Sollozzo tried again. “The Tattaglia family will guarantee your investment also.” It was then that Sonny Corleone made an unforgivable error in judgment and procedure.He said eagerly, “The Tattaglia family guarantees the return of our investment without anypercentage from us?” Hagen was horrified at this break. He saw the Don turn cold, malevolent eyes on hiseldest son, who froze in uncomprehending dismay. Sollozzo’s eyes flickered again but this timewith satisfaction. He had discovered a chink in the Don’s fortress. When the Don spoke his voice65held a dismissal. “Young people are greedy,” he said. “And today they have no manners. Theyinterrupt their elders. They meddle. But I have a sentimental weakness for my children and Ihave spoiled them. As you see. Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. Let me say that I myself wishyou good fortune in your business. It has no conflict with my own. I’m sorry that I had todisappoint you.” Sollozzo bowed, shook the Don’s hand and let Hagen take him to his car outside. Therewas no expression on his face when he said good-bye to Hagen. Back in the room, Don Corleone asked Hagen, “What did you think of that man?” “He’s a Sicilian,” Hagen said dryly. The Don nodded his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to his son and said gently,“Santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. Never let them knowwhat you have under your fingernails. I think your brain is going soft from all that comedy youplay with that young girl. Stop it and pay attention to business. Now get out of my sight.” Hagen saw the surprise on Sonny’s face, then anger at his father’s reproach. Did he reallythink the Don would be ignorant of his conquest, Hagen wondered. And did he really not knowwhat a dangerous mistake he had made this morning? If that were true, Hagen would never wishto be the Consigliere to the Don of Santino Corleone. Don Corleone waited until Sonny had left the room. Then he sank back into his leatherarmchair and motioned brusquely for a drink. Hagen poured him a glass of anisette. The Donlooked up at him. “Send Luca Brasi to see me,” he said. Three months later, Hagen hurried through the paper work in his city office hoping toleave early enough for some Christmas shopping for his wife and children. He was interrupted bya phone call from a Johnny Fontane bubbling with high spirits. The picture had been shot, therushes, whatever the hell they were, Hagen thought, were fabulous. He was sending the Don apresent for Christmas that would knock his eyes out, he’d bring it himself but there were somelittle things to be done in the movie. He would have to stay out on the Coast. Hagen tried toconceal his impatience. Johnny Fontane’s charm had always been lost on him. But his interestwas aroused. “What is it?” he asked. Johnny Fontane chuckled and said, “I can’t tell, that’s thebest part of a Christmas present.” Hagen immediately lost all interest and finally managed,politely, to hang up.66 Ten minutes later his secretary told him that Connie Corleone was on the phone andwanted to speak to him. Hagen sighed. As a young girl Connie had been nice, as a marriedwoman she was a nuisance. She made complaints about her husband. She kept going home tovisit her mother for two or three days. And Carlo Rizzi was turning out to be a real loser. He hadbeen fixed up with a nice little business and was running it into the ground. He was also drinking,whoring around, gambling and beating his wife up occasionally. Connie hadn’t told her familyabout that but she had told Hagen. He wondered what new tale of woe she had for him now. But the Christmas spirit seemed to have cheered her up. She just wanted to ask Hagenwhat her father would really like for Christmas. And Sonny and Fred and Mike. She alreadyknew what she would get her mother. Hagen made some suggestions, all of which she rejected assilly. Finally she let him go. When the phone rang again, Hagen threw his papers back into the basket. The hell with it.He’d leave. It never occurred to him to refuse to take the call, however. When his secretary toldhim it was Michael Corleone he picked up the phone with pleasure. He had always liked Mike. “Tom,” Michael Corleone said, “I’m driving down to the city with Kay tomorrow.There’s something important I want to tell the old man before Christmas. Will he be hometomorrow night?” “Sure,” Hagen said. “He’s not going out of town until after Christmas. Anything I can dofor you?” Michael was as closemouthed as his father. “No,” he said. “I guess I’ll see you Christmas,everybody is going to be out at Long Beach, right?” “Right,” Hagen said. He was amused when Mike hung up on him without any small talk. He told his secretary to call his wife and tell her he would be home a little late but to havesome supper for him. Outside the building he walked briskly downtown toward Macy’s.Someone stepped in his way. To his surprise he saw it was Sollozzo. Sollozzo took him by the arm and said quietly, “Don’t be frightened. I just want to talk toyou.” A car parked at the curb suddenly had its door open. Sollozzo said urgently, “Get in, I wantto talk to you.” Hagen pulled his arm loose. He was still not alarmed, just irritated. “I haven’t got time,”he said. At that moment two men came up behind him. Hagen felt a sudden weakness in his legs.Sollozzo said softly, “Get in the car. If I wanted to kill you you’d be dead now. Trust me.”67 Without a shred of trust Hagen got into the car. Michael Corleone had lied to Hagen. He was already in New York, and he had calledfrom a room in the Hotel Pennsylvania less than ten blocks away. When he hung up the phone,Kay Adams put out her cigarette and said, “Mike, what a good fibber you are.” Michael sat down beside her on the bed.” All for you, honey; if I told my family we werein town we’d have to go there right away. Then we couldn’t go out to dinner, we couldn’t go tothe theater, and we couldn’t sleep together tonight. Not in my father’s house, not when we’re notmarried.” He put his arms around her and kissed her gently on the lips. Her mouth was sweet andhe gently pulled her down on the bed. She closed her eyes, waiting for him to make love to herand Michael felt an enormous happiness. He had spent the war years fighting in the Pacific, andon those bloody islands he had dreamed of a girl like Kay Adams. Of a beauty like hers. A fairand fragile body, milky-skinned and electrified by passion. She opened her eyes and then pulledhis head down to kiss him. They made love until it was time for dinner and the theater. After dinner they walked past the brightly lit department stores full of holiday shoppersand Michael said to her, “What shall I get you for Christmas?” She pressed against him. “Just you,” she said. “Do you think your father will approve ofme?” Michael said gently, “That’s not really the question. Will your parents approve of me?” Kay shrugged. “I don’t care,” she said. Michael said, “I even thought of changing my name, legally, but if something happened,that wouldn’t really help. You sure you want to be a Corleone?” He said it only half-jokingly. “Yes,” she said without smiling. They pressed against each other. They had decided toget married during Christmas week, a quiet civil ceremony at City Hall with just two friends aswitnesses. But Michael had insisted he must tell his father. He had explained that his fatherwould not object in any way as long as it was not done in secrecy. Kay was doubtful. She saidshe could not tell her parents until after the marriage. “Of course they’ll think I’m pregnant,” shesaid. Michael grinned. “So will my parents,” he said. What neither of them mentioned was the fact that Michael would have to cut his closeties with his family. They both understood that Michael had already done so to some extent andyet they both felt guilty about this fact. They planned to finish college, seeing each other68weekends and living together during summer vacations. It seemed like a happy life. The play was a musical called Carousel and its sentimental story of a braggart thief madethem smile at each other with amusement. When they came out of the theater it had turned cold.Kay snuggled up to him and said, “ After we’re married, will you beat me and then steal a starfor a present?” Michael laughed. “I’m going to be a mathematics professor,” he said. Then he asked, “Doyou want something to eat before we go to the hotel?” Kay shook her head. She looked up at him meaningfully. As always he was touched byher eagerness to make love. He smiled down at her, and they kissed in the cold street. Michaelfelt hungry, and he decided to order sandwiches sent up to the room. In the hotel lobby Michael pushed Kay toward the newsstand and said, “Get the paperswhile I get the key.” He had to wait in a small line; the hotel was still short of help despite theend of the war. Michael got his room key and looked around impatiently for Kay. She wasstanding by the newsstand, staring down at a newspaper she held in her hand. He walked towardher. She looked up at him. Her eyes were filled with tears. “Oh, Mike,” she said, “oh, Mike.” Hetook the paper from her hands. The first thing he saw was a photo of his father lying in the street,his head in a pool of blood. A man was sitting on the curb weeping like a child. It was his brotherFreddie. Michael Corleone felt his body turning to ice. There was no grief, no fear, just cold rage.He said to Kay, “Go up to the room.” But he had to take her by the arm and lead her into theelevator. They rode up together in silence. In their room, Michael sat down on the bed andopened the paper. The headlines said, VITO CORLEONE SHOT. ALLEGED RACKET CHIEFCRITICALLY WOUNDED. OPERATED ON UNDER HEAVY POLICE GUARD. BLOODYMOB WAR FEARED. Michael felt the weakness in his legs. He said to Kay, “He’s not dead, the bastards didn’tkill him.” He read the story again. His father had been shot at five in the afternoon. That meantthat while he had been making love to Kay, having dinner, enjoying the theater, his father wasnear death. Michael felt sick with guilt. Kay said, “Shall we go down to the hospital now?” Michael shook his head. “Let me call the house first. The people who did this are crazyand now that the old man’s still alive they’ll be desperate. Who the hell knows what they’ll pullnext.”69 Both phones in the Long Beach house were busy and it was almost twenty minutes beforeMichael could get through. He heard Sonny’s voice saying, “Yeah.” “Sonny, it’s me,” Michael said. He could hear the relief in Sonny’s voice, “Jesus, kid, you had us worried. Where the hellare you? I’ve sent people to that hick town of yours to see what happened.” “How’s the old man?” Michael said. “How bad is he hurt?” “Pretty bad,” Sonny said...They shot him five times. But he’s tough.” Sonny’s voice wasproud. “The doctors said he’ll pull through. Listen, kid, I’m busy, I can’t talk, where are you?” “In New York,” Michael said...Didn’t Tom tell you I was coming down?” Sonny’s voice dropped a little. “They’ve snatched Tom. That’s why I was worried aboutyou. His wife is here. She don’t know and neither do the cops. I don’t want them to know. Thebastards who pulled this must be crazy. I want you to get out here right away and keep yourmouth shut. OK?” “OK,” Mike said, “do you know who did it?” “Sure,” Sonny said...And as soon as Luca Brasi checks in they’re gonna be dead meat.We still have all the horses.” “I’ll be out in a hour,” Mike said. “In a cab.” He hung up. The papers had been on thestreets for over three hours. There must have been radio news reports. It was almost impossiblethat Luca hadn’t heard the news. Thoughtfully Michael pondered the question. Where was LucaBrasi? It was the same question that Hagen was asking himself at that moment. It was the samequestion that was worrying Sonny Corleone out in Long Beach. At a quarter to five that afternoon, Don Corleone had finished checking the papers theoffice manager of his olive oil company had prepared for him. He put on his jacket and rappedhis knuckles on his son Freddie’s head to make him take his nose out of the afternoon newspaper.“Tell Gatto to get the car from the lot,” he said. “I’ll be ready to go home in a few minutes.” Freddie grunted. “I’ll have to get it myself. Paulie called in sick this morning. Got a coldagain.” Don Corleone looked thoughtful for a moment. “That’s the third time this month. I thinkmaybe you’d better get a healthier fellow for this job. Tell Tom.” Fred protested. “Paulie’s a good kid. If he says he’s sick, he’s sick. I don’t mind getting70the car.” He left the office. Don Corleone watched out the window as his son crossed NinthAvenue to the parking lot. He stopped to call Hagen’s office but there was no answer. He calledthe house at Long Beach but again there was no answer. Irritated, he looked out the window. Hiscar was parked at the curb in front of his building. Freddie was leaning against the fender, armsfolded, watching the throng of Christmas shoppers. Don Corleone put on his jacket. The officemanager helped him with his overcoat. Don Corleone grunted his thanks and went out the doorand started down the two flights of steps. Out in the street the early winter light was failing. Freddie leaned casually against thefender of the heavy Buick. When he saw his father come out of the building Freddie went outinto the street to the driver’s side of the car and got in. Don Corleone was about to get in on thesidewalk side of the car when he hesitated and then turned back to the long open fruit stand nearthe corner. This had been his habit lately, he loved the big out-of-season fruits, yellow peachesand oranges, that glowed in their green boxes. The proprietor sprang to serve him. Don Corleonedid not handle the fruit. He pointed. The fruit man disputed his decisions only once, to show himthat one of his choices had a rotten underside. Don Corleone took the paper bag in his left handand paid the man with a five-dollar bill. He took his change and, as he turned to go back to thewaiting car, two men stepped from around the corner. Don Corleone knew immediately whatwas to happen. The two men wore black overcoats and black hats pulled low to prevent identification bywitnesses. They had not expected Don Corleone’s alert reaction. He dropped the bag of fruit anddarted toward the parked car with startling quickness for a man of his bulk. At the same time heshouted, “Fredo, Fredo.” It was only then that the two men drew their guns and fired. The first bullet caught Don Corleone in the back. He felt the hammer shock of its impactbut made his body move toward the car. The next two bullets hit him in the buttocks and senthim sprawling in the middle of the street. Meanwhile the two gunmen, careful not to slip on therolling fruit, started to follow in order to finish him off. At that moment, perhaps no more thanfive seconds after the Don’s call to his son, Frederico Corleone appeared out of his car, loomingover it. The gunmen fired two more hasty shots at the Don lying in the gutter. One hit him in thefleshy part of his arm and the second hit him in the calf of his right leg. Though these woundswere the least serious they bled profusely, forming small pools of blood beside his body. But bythis time Don Corleone had lost consciousness.71 Freddie had heard his father shout, calling him by his childhood name, and then he hadheard the first two loud reports. By the time he got out of the car he was in shock, he had noteven drawn his gun. The two assassins could easily have shot him down. But they too panicked.They must have known the son was armed, and besides too much time had passed. Theydisappeared around the corner, leaving Freddie alone in the street with his father’s bleeding body.Many of the people thronging the avenue had flung themselves into doorways or on the ground,others had huddled together in small groups. Freddie still had not drawn his weapon. He seemed stunned. He stared down at hisfather’s body lying face down on the tarred street, lying now in what seemed to him a blackishlake of blood. Freddie went into physical shock. People eddied out again and someone, seeinghim start to sag, led him to the curbstone and made him sit down on it. A crowd gathered aroundDon Corleone’s body, a circle that shattered when the first police car sirened a path through them.Directly behind the police was the Daily News radio car and even before it stopped aphotographer jumped out to snap pictures of the bleeding Don Corleone. A few moments later anambulance arrived. The photographer turned his attention to Freddie Corleone, who was nowweeping openly, and this was a curiously comical sight, because of his tough, Cupid-featuredface, heavy nose and thick mouth smeared with snot. Detectives were spreading through thecrowd and more police cars were coming up. One detective knelt beside Freddie, questioninghim, but Freddie was too deep in shock to answer. The detective reached inside Freddie’s coatand lifted his wallet. He looked at the identification inside and whistled to his partner. In just afew seconds Freddie had been cut off from the crowd by a flock of plainclothesmen. The firstdetective found Freddie’s gun in its shoulder holster and took it. Then they lifted Freddie off hisfeet and shoved him into an unmarked car. As that car pulled away it was followed by the DailyNews radio car. The photographer was still snapping pictures of everybody and everything. In the half hour after the shooting of his father, Sonny Corleone received five phone callsin rapid succession. The first was from Detective John Phillips, who was on the family payrolland had been in the lead car of plainclothesmen at the scene of the shooting. The first thing hesaid to Sonny over the phone was, “Do you recognize my voice?” “Yeah,” Sonny said. He was fresh from a nap, called to the phone by his wife. Phillips said quickly without preamble, “Somebody shot your father outside his place.72Fifteen minutes ago. He’s alive but hurt bad. They’ve taken him to French Hospital. They gotyour brother Freddie down at the Chelsea precinct. You better get him a doctor when they turnhim loose. I’m going down to the hospital now to help question your old man, if he can talk. I’llkeep you posted.” Across the table, Sonny’s wife Sandra noticed that her husband’s face had gone red withflushing blood. His eyes were glazed over. She whispered, “What’s the matter?” He waved at herimpatiently to shut up, swung his body away so that his back was toward her and said into thephone, “You sure he’s alive?” “Yeah, I’m sure,” the detective said. “A lot of blood but I think maybe he’s not as bad ashe looks.” “Thanks,” Sonny said. “Be home tomorrow morning eight sharp. You got a grandcoming.” Sonny cradled the phone. He forced himself to sit still. He knew that his greatestweakness was his anger and this was one time when anger could be fatal. The first thing to dowas get Tom Hagen. But before he could pick up the phone, it rang. The call was from thebookmaker licensed by the Family to operate in the district of the Don’s office. The bookmakerhad called to tell him that the Don had been killed, shot dead in the street. After a few questionsto make sure that the bookmaker’s informant had not been close to the body, Sonny dismissedthe information as incorrect. Phillips’ dope would be more accurate. The phone rang almostimmediately a third time. It was a reporter from the Daily News. As soon as he identified himself,Sonny Corleone hung up. He dialed Hagen’s house and asked Hagen’s wife, “Did Tom come home yet?” She said,“No,” that he was not due for another twenty minutes but she expected him home for supper.“Have him call me,” Sonny said. He tried to think things out. He tried to imagine how his father would react in a likesituation. He had known immediately that this was an attack by Sollozzo, but Sollozzo wouldnever have dared to eliminate so high-ranking a leader as the Don unless he was backed by otherpowerful people. The phone, ringing for the fourth time, interrupted his thoughts. The voice onthe other end was very soft, very gentle. “Santino Corleone?” it asked. “Yeah,” Sonny said. “We have Tom Hagen,” the voice said. “In about three hours he’ll be released with our73proposition. Don’t do anything rash until you’ve heard what he has to say. You can only cause alot of trouble. What’s done is done. Everybody has to be sensible now. Don’t lose that famoustemper of yours.” The voice was slightly mocking. Sonny couldn’t be sure, but it sounded likeSollozzo. He made his voice sound muted, depressed. “I’ll wait,” he said. He heard the receiveron the other end click. He looked at his heavy gold-banded wristwatch and noted the exact timeof the call and jotted it down on the tablecloth. He sat at the kitchen table, frowning. His wife asked, “Sonny, what is it?” He told hercalmly, “They shot the old man.” When he saw the shock on her face he said roughly, “Don’tworry, he’s not dead. And nothing else is going to happen.” He did not tell her about Hagen. Andthen the phone rang for the fifth time. It was Clemenza. The fat man’s voice came wheezing over the phone in gruntlike gasps.“You hear about your father?” he asked. “Yeah.” Sonny said. “But he’s not dead.” There was a long pause over the phone andthen Clemenza’s voice came packed with emotion, “Thank God, thank God.” Then anxiously,“You sure? I got word he was dead in the street.” “He’s alive,” Sonny said. He was listening intently to every intonation in Clemenza’svoice. The emotion had seemed genuine but it was part of the fat man’s profession to be a goodactor. “You’ll have to carry the ball, Sonny,” Clemenza said. “What do you want me to do?” “Get over to my father’s house,” Sonny said. “Bring Paulie Gat to.” “That’s all?” Clemenza asked. “Don’t you want me to send some people to the hospitaland your place?” “No, I just want you and Paulie Gat to,” Sonny said. There was a long pause. Clemenzawas getting the message. To make it a little more natural, Sonny asked, “Where the hell wasPaulie anyway? What the hell was he doing?” There was no longer any wheezing on the other end of the line. Clemenza’s voice wasguarded. “Paulie was sick, he had a cold, so he stayed home. He’s been a little sick all winter.” Sonny was instantly alert. “How many times did he stay home the last couple ofmonths?” “Maybe three or four times,” Clemenza said. “I always asked Freddie if he wantedanother guy but he said no. There’s been no cause, the last ten years things been smooth, you74know.” “Yeah,” Sonny said. “I’ll see you at my father’s house. Be sure you bring Paulie. Pickhim up on your way over. I don’t care how sick he is. You got that?” He slammed down thephone without waiting for an answer. His wife was weeping silently. He stared at her for a moment, then said in a harsh voice,“ Any of our people call, tell them to get me in my father’s house on his special phone. Anybodyelse call, you don’t know nothing. If Tom’s wife calls, tell her that Tom won’t be home for awhile, he’s on business.” He pondered for a moment.” A couple of our people will come to stay here.” He saw herlook of fright and said impatiently, “You don’t have to be scared, I just want them here. Dowhatever they tell you to do. If you wanta talk to me, get me on Pop’s special phone but don’tcall me unless it’s really important. And don’t worry.” He went out of the house. Darkness had fallen and the December wind whipped through the mall. Sonny had nofear about stepping out into the night. All eight houses were owned by Don Corleone. At themouth of the mall the two houses on either side were rented by family retainers with their ownfamilies and star boarders, single men who lived in the basement apartments. Of the remainingsix houses that formed the rest of the half circle, one was inhabited by Tom Hagen and his family,his own, and the smallest and least ostentatious by the Don himself. The other three houses weregiven rent-free to retired friends of the Don with the understanding that they would be vacatedwhenever he requested. The harmless-looking mall was an impregnable fortress. All eight houses were equipped with floodlights which bathed the grounds around themand made the mall impossible to lurk in. Sonny went across the street to his father’s house andlet himself inside with his own key. He yelled out, “Ma, where are you?” and his mother cameout of the kitchen. Behind her rose the smell of frying peppers. Before she could say anything,Sonny took her by the arm and made her sit down. “I just got a call,” he said. “Now don’t getworried. Pop’s in the hospital, he’s hurt. Get dressed and get ready to get down there. I’ll have acar and a driver for you in a little while. OK?” His mother looked at him steadily for a moment and then asked in Italian, “Have theyshot him?” Sonny nodded. His mother bowed her head for a moment. Then she went back into thekitchen. Sonny followed her. He watched her turn off the gas under the panful of peppers andhen go out and up to the bedroom. He took peppers from the pan and bread from the basket onthe table and made a sloppy sandwich with hot olive oil dripping from his fingers. He went intothe huge corner room that was his father’s office and took the special phone from a lockedcabinet box. The phone had been especially installed and was listed under a phony name and aphony address. The first person he called was Luca Brasi. There was no answer. Then he calledthe safety-valve caporegime in Brooklyn, a man of unquestioned loyalty to the Don. This man’sname was Tessio. Sonny told him what had happened and what he wanted. Tessio was to recruitfifty absolutely reliable men. He was to send guards to the hospital, he was to send men out toLong Beach to work here. Tessio asked, “Did they get Clemenza too?” Sonny said, “I don’t wantto use Clemenza’s people right now.” Tessio understood immediately, there was a pause, andthen he said, “Excuse me, Sonny, I say this as your father would say it. Don’t move too fast. Ican’t believe Clemenza would betray us.” “Thanks,” Sonny said. “I don’t think so but I have to be careful. Right?” “Right,” Tessio said.” Another thing,” Sonny said. “My kid brother Mike goes to college in Hanover, NewHampshire. Get some people we know in Boston to go up and get him and bring him down hereto the house until this blows over. I’ll call him up so he’ll expect them. Again I’m just playingthe percentages, just to make sure.” “OK,” Tessio said, “I’ll be over your father’s house as soon as I get things rolling. OK?You know my boys, right?” “Yeah,” Sonny said. He hung up. He went over to a small wall safe and unlocked it.From it he took an indexed book bound in blue leather. He opened it to the T’s until he found theentry he was looking for. It read, “Ray Farrell $5,000 Christmas Eve.” This was followed by atelephone number. Sonny dialed the number and said, “Farrell?” The man on the other endanswered, “Yes.” Sonny said, “This is Santino Corleone. I want you to do me a favor and I wantyou to do it right away. I want you to check two phone numbers and give me all the calls theygot and all the calls they made for the last three months.” He gave Farrell the number of PaulieGatto ‘s home and Clemenza’s home. Then he said, “This is important. Get it to me beforemidnight and you’ll have an extra very Merry Christmas.” Before he settled back to think things out he gave Luca Brasi’s number one more call.Again there was no answer. This worried him but he put it out of his mind. Luca would come to76the house as soon as he heard the news. Sonny leaned back in the swivel chair. In an hour thehouse would be swarming with Family people and he would have to tell them all what to do, andnow that he finally had time to think he realized how serious the situation was. It was the firstchallenge to the Corleone Family and their power in ten years. There was no doubt that Sollozzowas behind it, but he would never have dared attempt such a stroke unless he had support from atleast one of the five great New York families. And that support must have come from theTattaglias. Which meant a full-scale war or an immediate settlement on Sollozzo’s terms. Sonnysmiled grimly. The wily Turk had planned well but he had been unlucky. The old man was aliveand so it was war. With Luca Brasi and the resources of the Corleone Family there could be butone outcome. But again the nagging worry. Where was Luca Brasi?Chapter 3 Counting the driver, there were four men in the car with Hagen. They put him in the backseat, in the middle of the two men who had come up behind him in the street. Sollozzo sat upfront. The man on Hagen’s right reached over across his body and tilted Hagen’s hat over hiseyes so that he could not see. “Don’t even move your pinkie,” he said. It was a short ride, not more than twenty minutes and when they got out of the car Hagencould not recognize the neighborhood because darkness had fallen. They led him into a basementapartment and made him’ sit on a straight-backed kitchen chair. Sollozzo sat across the kitchentable from him. His dark face had a peculiarly vulturine look. “I don’t want you to be afraid,” he said. “I know you’re not in the muscle end of theFamily. I want you to help the Corleones and I want you to help me.” Hagen’s hands were shaking as he put a cigarette in his mouth. One of the men brought abottle of rye to the table and gave him a slug of it in a china coffee cup. Hagen drank the fieryliquid gratefully. It steadied his hands and took the weakness out of his legs. “Your boss is dead,” Sollozzo said. He paused, surprised at the tears that sprang toHagen’s eyes. Then he went on. “We got him outside his office, in the street. As soon as I got theword, I picked you up. You have to make the peace between me and Sonny.” Hagen didn’t answer. He was surprised at his own grief. And the feeling of desolationmixed with his fear of death. Sollozzo was speaking again. “Sonny was hot for my deal. Right?77You know it’s the smart thing to do too. Narcotics is the coming thing. There’s so much moneyin it that everybody can get rich just in a couple of years. The Don was an old ‘Moustache Pete,’his day was over but he didn’t know it. Now he’s dead, nothing can bring him back. I’m ready tomake a new deal, I want you to talk Sonny into taking it.” Hagen said, “You haven’t got a chance. Sonny will come after you with everything he’sgot.” Sollozzo said impatiently, “That’s gonna be his first reaction. You have to talk somesense to him. The Tattaglia Family stands behind me with all their people. The other New Yorkfamilies will go along with anything that will stop a full-scale war between us. Our war has tohurt them and their businesses. If Sonny goes along with the deal, the other Families in thecountry will consider it none of their affair, even the Don’s oldest friends.” Hagen stared down at his hands, not answering. Sollozzo went on persuasively. “The Donwas slipping. In the old days I could never have gotten to him. The other Families distrust himbecause he made you his Consigliere and you’re not even Italian, much less Sicilian. If it goes toall-out war the Corleone Family will be smashed and everybody loses, me included. I need theFamily political contacts more than I need the money even. So talk to Sonny, talk to thecaporegimes; you’ll save a lot of bloodshed.” Hagen held out his china cup for more whiskey. “I’ll try,” he said. “But Sonny isstrong-headed. And even Sonny won’t be able to call off Luca. You have to worry about Luca.I’ll have to worry about Luca if I go for your deal.” Sollozzo said quietly, “I’ll take care of Luca. You take care of Sonny and the other twokids. Listen, you can tell them that Freddie would have gotten it today with his old man but mypeople had strict orders not to gun him. I didn’t want any more hard feelings than necessary. Youcan tell them that, Freddie is alive because of me.” Finally Hagen’s mind was working. For the first time he really believed that Sollozzo didnot mean to kill him or hold him as a hostage. The sudden relief from fear that flooded his bodymade him flush with shame. Sollozzo watched him with a quiet understanding smile. Hagenbegan to think things out. If he did not agree to argue Sollozzo’s case, he might be killed. Butthen he realized that Sollozzo expected him only to present it and present it properly, as he wasbound to do as a responsible Consigliere. And now, thinking about it, he also realized thatSollozzo was right. An unlimited war between the Tattaglias and the Corleones must be avoided78at all costs. The Corleones must bury their dead and forget, make a deal. And then when the timewas right they could move against Sollozzo. But glancing up, he realized that Sollozzo knew exactly what he was thinking. The Turkwas smiling. And then it struck Hagen. What had happened to Luca Brasi that Sollozzo was sounconcerned? Had Luca made a deal? He remembered that on the night Don Corleone hadrefused Sollozzo, Luca had been summoned into the office for a private conference with the Don.But now was not the time to worry about such details. He had to get back to the safety of theCorleone Family fortress in Long Beach. “I’ll do my best,” he said to Sollozzo. “I believe you’reright, it’s even what the Don would want us to do.” Sollozzo nodded gravely. “Fine,” he said. “I don’t like bloodshed, I’m a businessman andblood costs too much money.” At that moment the phone rang and one of the men sitting behindHagen went to answer it. He listened and then said curtly, “OK, I’ll tell him.” He hung up thephone, went to Sollozzo’s side and whispered in the Turk’s ear. Hagen saw Sollozzo’s face gopale, his eyes glitter with rage. He himself felt a thrill of fear. Sollozzo was looking at himspeculatively and suddenly Hagen knew that he was no longer going to be set free. Thatsomething had happened that might mean his death. Sollozzo said, “The old man is still alive.Five bullets in his Sicilian hide and he’s still alive.” He gave a fatalistic shrug. “Bad luck,” hesaid to Hagen. “Bad luck for me. Bad luck for you.”Chapter 4 When Michael Corleone arrived at his father’s house in Long Beach he found the narrowentrance mouth of the mall blocked off with a link chain. The mall itself was bright with thefloodlights of all eight houses, outlining at least ten cars parked along the curving cement walk. Two men he didn’t know were leaning against the chain. One of them asked in aBrooklyn accent, “Who’re you?” He told them. Another man came out of the nearest house and peered at his face. “That’sthe Don’s kid,” he said. “I’ll bring him inside.” Mike followed this man to his father’s house,where two men at the door let him and his escort pass inside. The house seemed to be full of men he didn’t know, until he went into the living room.There Michael saw Tom Hagen’s wife, Theresa, sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette.79On the coffee table in front of her was a glass of whiskey. On the other side of the sofa sat thebulky Clemenza. The caporegime’s face was impassive, but he was sweating and the cigar in hishand glistened slickly black with his saliva. Clemenza came to wring his hand in a consoling way, muttering, “Your mother is at thehospital with your father, he’s going to be all right.” Paulie Gatto stood up to shake hands.Michael looked at him curiously. He knew Paulie was his father’s bodyguard but did not knowthat Paulie had stayed home sick that day. But he sensed tension in the thin dark face. He knewGatto ‘s reputation as an up-and-coming man, a very quick man who knew how to get delicatejobs done without complications, and today he had failed in his duty. He noticed several othermen in the comers of the room but he did not recognize them. They were not of Clemenza’speople. Michael put these facts together and understood. Clemenza and Gatto were suspect.Thinking that Paulie had been at the scene, he asked the ferret-faced young man, “How isFreddie? He OK?” “The doctor gave him a shot,” Clemenza said. “He’s sleeping.” Michael went to Hagen’s wife and bent down to kiss her cheek. They had always likedeach other. He whispered, “Don’t worry, Tom will be OK. Have you talked to Sonny yet?” Theresa clung to him for a moment and shook her head. She was a delicate, very prettywoman, more American than Italian, and very scared. He took her hand and lifted her off thesofa. Then he led her into his father’s corner room office. Sonny was sprawled out in his chair behind the desk holding a yellow pad in one handand a pencil in the other. The only other man in the room with him was the caporegime Tessio,whom Michael recognized and immediately realized that it must be his men who were in thehouse and forming the new palace guard. He too had a pencil and pad in his hands. When Sonny saw them he came from behind his desk and took Hagen’s wife in his arms.“Don’t worry, Theresa,” he said. “Tom’s OK. They just wanta give him the proposition, theysaid they’d turn him loose. He’s not on the operating end, he’s just our lawyer. There’s no reasonfor anybody to do him harm.” He released Theresa and then to Michael’s surprise he too, got a hug and a kiss on thecheek. He pushed Sonny away and said grinning, “ After I get used to you beating me up I gottaput up with this?” They had often fought when they were younger. Sonny shrugged. “Listen, kid, I was worried when I couldn’t get ahold of you in that hick80town. Not that I gave a crap if they knocked you off, but I didn’t like the idea of bringing thenews to the old lady. I had to tell her about Pop.” “How’d she take it?” Michael asked. “Good,” Sonny said. “She’s been through it before. Me too. You were too young to knowabout it and then things got pretty smooth while you were growing up.” He paused and then said,“She’s down at the hospital with the old man. He’s gonna pull through.” “How about us going down?” Michael asked. Sonny shook his head and said dryly, “I can’t leave this house until it’s all over.” Thephone rang. Sonny picked it up and listened intently. While he was listening Michael saunteredover to the desk and glanced down at the yellow pad Sonny had been writing on. There was a listof seven names. The first three were Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia, and John Tattaglia. It struckMichael with full force that he had interrupted Sonny and Tessio as they were making up a list ofmen to be killed. When Sonny hung up the phone he said to Theresa Hagen and Michael, “Can you twowait outside? I got some business with Tessio we have to finish.” Hagen’s wife said, “Was that call about Tom?” She said it almost truculently but she wasweeping with fright. Sonny put his arm around her and led her to the door. “I swear he’s going tobe OK,” he said. “Wait in the living room. I’ll come out as soon as I hear something.” He shutthe door behind her. Michael had sat down in one of the big leather armchairs. Sonny gave him aquick sharp look and then went to sit down behind the desk. “You hang around me, Mike,” he said, “you’re gonna hear things you don’t wanta hear.” Michael lit a cigarette. “I can help out,” he said. “No, you can’t,” Sonny said. “The old man would be sore as hell if I let you get mixed upin this.” Michael stood up and yelled. “You lousy bastard, he’s my father. I’m not supposed tohelp him? I can help. I don’t have to go out and kill people but I can help. Stop treating me like akid brother. I was in the war. I got shot, remember? I killed some Japs. What the hell do youthink I’ll do when you knock somebody off? Faint?” Sonny grinned at him. “Pretty soon you’ll want me to put up my dukes. OK, stick around,you can handle the phone.” He turned to Tessio. “That call I just got gave me dope we needed.”He turned to Michael. “Somebody had to finger the old man. It could have been Clemenza, it81could have been Paulie Gat to, who was very conveniently sick today. I know the answer now,let’s see how smart you are, Mike, you’re the college boy. Who sold out to Sollozzo?” Michael sat down again and relaxed back into the leather armchair. He thoughteverything over very carefully. Clemenza was a caporegime in the Corleone Family structure.Don Corleone had made him a millionaire and they had been intimate friends for over twentyyears. He held one of the most powerful posts in the organization. What could Clemenza gain forbetraying his Don? More money? He was rich enough but then men are always greedy. Morepower? Revenge for some fancied insult or slight? That Hagen had been made the Consigliere?Or perhaps a businessman’s conviction that Sollozzo would win out? No, it was impossible forClemenza to be a traitor, and then Michael thought sadly it was only impossible because hedidn’t want Clemenza to die. The fat man had always brought him gifts when he was growing up,had sometimes taken him on outings when the Don had been too busy. He could not believe thatClemenza was guilty of treachery. But, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in his pocket more than any otherman in the Corleone Family. Michael thought about Paulie Gat to. Paulie as yet had not become rich. He was wellthought of, his rise in the organization was certain but he would have to put in his time likeeverybody else. Also he would have wilder dreams of power, as the young always do. It had tobe Paulie. And then Michael remembered that in the sixth grade he and Paulie had been in thesame class in school and he didn’t want it to be Paulie either. He shook his head. “Neither one of them,” he said. But he said it only because Sonny hadsaid he had the answer. If it had been a vote, he would have voted Paulie guilty. Sonny was smiling at him. “Don’t worry,” he said. “Clemenza is OK. It’s Paulie.” Michael could see that Tessio was relieved. As a fellow caporegime his sympathy wouldbe with Clemenza. Also the present situation was not so serious if treachery did not reach so high.Tessio said cautiously, “Then I can send my people home tomorrow?” Sonny said, “The day after tomorrow. I don’t want anybody to know about this until then.Listen, I want to talk some family business with my brother, personal. Wait out in the livingroom, eh? We can finish our list later. You and Clemenza will work together on it.” “Sure,” Tessio said. He went out. “How do you know for sure it’s Paulie?” Michael asked.82 Sonny said, “We have people in the telephone company and they tracked down all ofPaulie’s phone calls in and out. Clemenza’s too. On the three days Paulie was sick this month hegot a call from a street booth across from the old man’s building. Today too. They were checkingto see if Paulie was coming down or somebody was being sent down to take his place. Or forsome other reason. It doesn’t matter.” Sonny shrugged. “Thank God it was Paulie. We’ll needClemenza bad.” Michael asked hesitantly, “Is it going to be an all-out war?” Sonny’s eyes were hard. “That’s how I’m going to play it as soon as Tom checks in.Until the old man tells me different.” Michael asked, “So why don’t you wait until the old man can tell you?” Sonny looked at him curiously. “How the hell did you win those combat medals? We areunder the gun, man, we gotta fight. I’m just afraid they won’t let Tom go.” Michael was surprised at this. “Why not?” Again Sonny’s voice was patient. “They snatched Tom because they figured the old manwas finished and they could make a deal with me and Tom would be the sit-down guy in thepreliminary stages, carry the proposition. Now with the old man alive they know I can’t make adeal so Tom’s no good to them. They can turn him loose or dump him, depending how Sollozzofeels. If they dump him, it would be just to show us they really mean business, trying to bulldozeus.” Michael said quietly, “What made Sollozzo think he could get a deal with you?” Sonny flushed and he didn’t answer for a moment. Then he said, “We had a meeting afew months ago, Sollozzo came to us with a proposition on drugs. The old man turned him down.But during the meeting I shot off my mouth a little, I showed I wanted the deal. Which isabsolutely the wrong thing to do; if there’s one thing the old man hammered into me it’s never todo a thing like that, to let other people know there’s a split of opinion in the Family. So Sollozzofigures he gets rid of the old man, I have to go in with him on the drugs. With the old man gone,the Family power is cut at least in half. I would be fighting for my life anyway to keep all thebusinesses the old man got together. Drugs are the coming thing, we should get into it. And hisknocking off the old man is purely business, nothing personal. As a matter of business I wouldgo in with him. Of course he would never let me get too close, he’d make sure I’d never get aclean shot at him, just in case. But he also knows that once I accepted the deal the other Families83would never let me start a war a couple of years later just for revenge. Also, the Tattaglia Familyis behind him.” “If they had gotten the old man, what would you have done?” Michael asked. Sonny said very simply, “Sollozzo is dead meat. I don’t care what it costs. I don’t care ifwe have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia Family is going to be wiped out.I don’t care if we all go down together.” Michael said softly, “That’s not how Pop would have played it.” Sonny made a violent gesture. “I know I’m not the man he was. But I’ll tell you this andhe’ll tell you too. When it comes to real action I can operate as good as anybody, short-range.Sollozzo knows that and so do Clemenza and Tessio, I ‘made my bones’ when I was nineteen,the last time the Family had a war, and I was a big help to the old man. So I’m not worried now.And our Family has all the horses in a deal like this. I just wish we could get contact with Luca.” Michael asked curiously, “Is Luca that tough, like they say? Is he that good?” Sonny nodded. “He’s in a class by himself. I’m going to send him after the threeTattaglias. I’ll get Sollozzo myself.” Michael shifted uneasily in his chair. He looked at his older brother. He rememberedSonny as being sometimes casually brutal but essentially warmhearted. A nice guy. It seemedunnatural to hear him talking this way, it was chilling to see the list of names he had scribbleddown, men to be executed, as if he were some newly crowned Roman Emperor. He was glad thathe was not truly part of all this, that now his father lived he did not have to involve himself invengeance. He’d help out, answering the phone, running errands and messages. Sonny and theold man could take care of themselves, especially with Luca behind them. At that moment they heard a woman scream in the living room. Oh, Christ, Michaelthought, it sounded like Tom’s wife. He rushed to the door and opened it. Everybody in theliving room was standing. And by the sofa Tom Hagen was holding Theresa close to him, hisface embarrassed. Theresa was weeping and sobbing, and Michael realized that the scream hehad heard had been her calling out her husband’s name with joy. As he watched, Tom Hagendisentangled himself from his wife’s arms and lowered her back onto the sofa. He smiled atMichael grimly. “Glad to see you, Mike, really glad.” He strode into the office without anotherlook at his still-sobbing wife. He hadn’t lived with the Corleone Family ten years for nothing,Michael thought with a queer flush of pride. Some of the old man had rubbed off on him, as it84had on Sonny, and he thought, with surprise, even on himself.Chapter 5 It was nearly four o’clock in the morning as they all sat in the corner room office--Sonny,Michael, Tom Hagen, Clemenza and Tessio. Theresa Hagen had been persuaded to go to herown home next door. Paulie Gatto was still waiting in the living room, not knowing that Tessio’smen had been instructed not to let him leave or let him out of their sight. Tom Hagen relayed the deal Sollozzo offered. He told how after Sollozzo had learned theDon still lived, it was obvious that he meant to kill Hagen. Hagen grinned. “If I ever plead beforethe Supreme Court, I’ll never plead better than I did with that goddamn Turk tonight. I told himI’d talk the Family into the deal even though the Don was alive. I told him I could wrap youaround my finger, Sonny. How we were buddies as kids; and don’t get sore, but I let him get theidea that maybe you weren’t too sorry about getting the old man’s job, God forgive me.” Hesmiled apologetically at Sonny, who made a gesture signifying that he understood, that it was ofno consequence. Michael, leaning back in his armchair with the phone at his right hand, studied both men.When Hagen had entered the room Sonny had come rushing to embrace him. Michael realizedwith a faint twinge of jealousy that in many ways Sonny and Tom Hagen were closer than hehimself could ever be to his own brother. “Let’s get down to business,” Sonny said. “We have to make plans. Take a look at thislist me and Tessio made up. Tessio, give Clemenza your copy.” “If we make plans,” Michael said, “Freddie should be here.” Sonny said grimly, “Freddie is no use to us. The doctor says he’s in shock so bad he hasto have complete rest. I don’t understand that. Freddie was always a pretty tough guy. I guessseeing the old man gunned down was hard on him, he always thought the Don was God. Hewasn’t like you and me, Mike.” Hagen said quickly, “OK, leave Freddie out. Leave him out of everything, absolutelyeverything. Now, Sonny, until this is allover I think you should stay in the house. I mean neverleave it. You’re safe here. Don’t underrate Sollozzo, he’s got to be a pezzonovante, a real .90caliber. Is the hospital covered?”85 Sonny nodded. “The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all thetime. What do you think of that list, Tom?” Hagen frowned down at the list of names. “Jesus Christ, Sonny, you’re really taking thispersonal. The Don would consider it a purely business dispute. Sollozzo is the key. Get rid ofSollozzo and everything falls in line. You don’t have to go after the Tattaglias.” Sonny looked at his two caporegimes. Tessio shrugged. “It’s tricky,” he said. Clemenzadidn’t answer at all. Sonny said to Clemenza, “One thing we can take care of without discussion. I don’t wantPaulie around here anymore. Make that first on your list.” The fat caporegime nodded. Hagen said, “What about Luca? Sollozzo didn’t seem worried about Luca. That worriesme. If Luca sold us out, we’re in real trouble. That’s the first thing we have to know. Hasanybody been able to get in touch with him?” “No,” Sonny said. “I’ve been calling him all night. Maybe he’s shacked up.” “No,” Hagen said. “He never sleeps over with a broad. He always goes home when he’sthrough. Mike, keep ringing his number until you get an answer.” Michael dutifully picked upthe phone and dialed. He could hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answered.Finally he hung up. “Keep trying every fifteen minutes,” Hagen said. Sonny said impatiently, “OK, Tom you’re the Consigliere, how about some advice?What the hell do you think we should do?” Hagen helped himself to the whiskey bottle on the desk. “We negotiate with Sollozzountil your father is in shape to take charge. We might even make a deal if we have to. When yourfather gets out of bed he can settle the whole business without a fuss and all the Families will goalong with him.” Sonny said angrily, “You think I can’t handle this guy Sollozzo?” Tom Hagen looked him directly in the eye. “Sonny, sure you can outfight him. TheCorleone Family has the power. You have Clemenza and Tessio here and they can muster athousand men if it comes to an all-out war. But at the end there will be a shambles over thewhole East Coast and all the other Families will blame the Corleones. We’ll make a lot ofenemies. And that’s something your father never believed in.” Michael, watching Sonny, thought he took this well. But then Sonny said to Hagen,“What if the old man dies, what do you advise then, Consigliere?”86Hagen said quietly, “I know you won’t do it, but I would advise you to make a real dealwith Sollozzo on the drugs. Without your father’s political contacts and personal influence theCorleone Family loses half its strength. Without your father, the other New York Families mightwind up supporting the Tattaglias and Sollozzo just to make sure there isn’t a long destructivewar. If your father dies, make the deal. Then wait and see.” Sonny was white-faced with anger. “That’s easy for you to say, it’s not your father theykilled.” Hagen said quickly and proudly, “I was as good a son to him as you or Mike, maybebetter. I’m giving you a professional opinion. Personally I want to kill all those bastards.” Theemotion in his voice shamed Sonny, who said, “Oh, Christ, Tom, I didn’t mean it that way.” Buthe had, really. Blood was blood and nothing else was its equal. Sonny brooded for a moment as the others waited in embarrassed silence. Then he sighedand spoke quietly. “OK, we’ll sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. But, Tom, I wantyou to stay inside the mall, too. Don’t take any chances. Mike, you be careful, though I don’tthink even Sollozzo would bring personal family into the war. Everybody would be against himthen. But be careful. Tessio, you hold your people in reserve but have them nosing around thecity. Clemenza, after you settle the Paulie Gatto thing, you move your men into the house and themall to replace Tessio’s people. Tessio, you keep your men at the hospital, though. Tom, startnegotiation over the phone or by messenger with Sollozzo and the Tattaglias the first thing in themorning. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza’s people and go to Luca’s house andwait for him to show up or find out where the hell he is. That crazy bastard might be going afterSollozzo right now if he’s heard the news. I can’t believe he’d ever go against his Don, no matterwhat the Turk offered him.” Hagen said reluctantly, “Maybe Mike shouldn’t get mixed up in this so directly.” “Right,” Sonny said. “Forget that, Mike. Anyway I need you on the phone here in thehouse, that’s more important.” Michael didn’t say anything. He felt awkward, almost ashamed, and he noticed Clemenzaand Tessio with faces so carefully impassive that he was sure that they were hiding theircontempt. He picked up the phone and dialed Luca Brasi’s number and kept the receiver to hisear as it rang and rang.87Chapter 6 Peter Clemenza slept badly that night. In the morning he got up early and made his ownbreakfast of a glass of grappa, a thick slice of Genoa salami with a chunk of fresh Italian breadthat was still delivered to his door as in the old days. Then he drank a great, plain china mugfilled with hot coffee that had been lashed with anisette. But as he padded about the house in hisold bathrobe and red felt slippers he pondered on the day’s work that lay ahead of him. Lastnight Sonny Corleone had made it very clear that Paulie Gatto was to be taken care ofimmediately. It had to be today. Clemenza was troubled. Not because Gatto had been his protégé and had turned traitor.This did not reflect on the caporegime’s judgment. After all, Paulie’s background had beenperfect. He came from a Sicilian family, he had grown up in the same neighborhood as theCorleone children, had indeed even gone to school with one of the sons. He had been brought upthrough each level in the proper manner. He had been tested and not found wanting. And thenafter he had “made his bones” he had received a good living from the Family, a percentage of anEast Side “book” and a union payroll slot. Clemenza had not been unaware that Paulie Gattosupplemented his income with free-lance stickups, strictly against the Family rules, but even thiswas a sign of the man’s worth. The breaking of such regulations was considered a sign ofhigh-spiritedness, like that shown by a fine racing horse fighting the reins. And Paulie had never caused trouble with his stickups. They had always beenmeticulously planned and carried out with the minimum of fuss and trouble, with no one evergetting hurt: a three-thousand-dollar Manhattan garment center payroll, a small chinawarefactory payroll in the slums of Brooklyn. After all, a young man could always use some extrapocket money. It was all in the pattern. Who could ever foretell that Paulie Gatto would turntraitor? What was troubling Peter Clemenza this morning was an administrative problem. Theactual execution of Gatto was a cut-and-dried chore. The problem was, who should thecaporegime bring up from the ranks to replace Gatto in the Family? It was an importantpromotion, that to “button” man, one not to be handed out lightly. The man had to be tough andhe had to be smart. He had to be safe, not a person who would talk to the police if he got in88trouble, one well saturated in the Sicilians’ law of omerta, the law of silence. And then, whatkind of a living would he receive for his new duties? Clemenza had several times spoken to theDon about better rewards for the all-important button man who was first in the front line whentrouble arose, but the Don had put him off. If Paulie had been making more money, he mighthave been able to resist the blandishments of the wily Turk, Sollozzo. Clemenza finally narrowed down the list of candidates to three men. The first was anenforcer who worked with the colored policy bankers in Harlem, a big brawny brute of a man ofgreat physical strength, a man with a great deal of personal charm who could get along withpeople and yet when necessary make them go in fear of him. But Clemenza scratched him off thelist after considering his name for a half hour. This man got along too well with the black people,which hinted at some flaw of character. Also he would be too hard to replace in the position henow held. The second name Clemenza considered and almost settled on was a hard-working chapwho served faithfully and well in the organization. This man was the collector of delinquentaccounts for Family-licensed shylocks in Manhattan. He had started off as a bookmaker’s runner.But he was not quite yet ready for such an important promotion. Finally he settled on Rocco Lampone. Lampone had served a short but impressiveapprenticeship in the Family. During the war he had been wounded in Africa and beendischarged in 1943. Because of the shortage of young men, Clemenza had taken him on eventhough Lampone was partially incapacitated by his injuries and walked with a pronounced limp.Clemenza had used him as a black-market contact in the garment center and with governmentemployees controlling OP A food stamps. From that, Lampone had graduated to trouble-shooterfor the whole operation. What Clemenza liked about him was his good judgment. He knew thatthere was no percentage in being tough about something that would only cost a heavy fine or sixmonths in jail, small prices to pay for the enormous profits earned. He had the good sense toknow that it was not an area for heavy threats but light ones. He kept the whole operation in aminor key, which was exactly what was needed. Clemenza felt the relief of a conscientious administrator who has solved a knottypersonnel problem. Yes, it would be Rocco Lampone who would assist. For Clemenza plannedto handle this job himself, not only to help a new, inexperienced man “make his bones,” but tosettle a personal score with Paulie Gat to. Paulie had been his protégé, he had advanced Paulie89over the heads of more deserving and more loyal people, he had helped Paulie “make his bones”and furthered his career in every way. Paulie had not only betrayed the Family, he had betrayedhis padrone, Peter Clemenza. This lack of respect had to be repaid. Everything else was arranged. Paulie Gatto had been instructed to pick him up at three inthe afternoon, and to pick him up with his own car, nothing hot. Now Clemenza took up thetelephone and dialed Rocco Lampone’s number. He did not identify himself. He simply said,“Come to my house, I have an errand for you.” He was pleased to note that despite the early hour,Lampone’s voice was not surprised or dazed with sleep and he simply said, “OK.” Good man.Clemenza added, “No rush, have your breakfast and lunch first before you come see me. But notlater than two in the afternoon.” There was another laconic OK on the other end and Clemenza hung up the phone. He hadalready alerted his people about replacing caporegime Tessio’s people in the Corleone mall sothat was done. He had capable subordinates and never interfered in a mechanical operation ofthat kind. He decided to wash his Cadillac. He loved the car. It gave him such a quiet peaceful ride,and its upholstery was so rich that he sometimes sat in it for an hour when the weather was goodbecause it was more pleasant than sitting in the house. And it always helped him think when hewas grooming the car. He remembered his father in Italy doing the same thing with donkeys. Clemenza worked inside the heated garage, he hated cold. He ran over his plans. You hadto be careful with Paulie, the man was like a rat, he could smell danger. And now of coursedespite being so tough he must be shitting in his pants because the old man was still alive. He’dbe as skittish as a donkey with ants up his ass. But Clemenza was accustomed to thesecircumstances, usual in his work. First, he had to have a good excuse for Rocco to accompanythem. Second, he had to have a plausible mission for the three of them to go on. Of course, strictly speaking, this was not necessary. Paulie Gatto could be killed withoutany of these frills. He was locked in, he could not run away. But Clemenza felt strongly that itwas important to keep good working habits and never give away a fraction of a percentage point.You never could tell what might happen and these matters were, after all, questions of life anddeath. As he washed his baby-blue Cadillac, Peter Clemenza pondered and rehearsed his lines,the expressions of his face. He would be curt with Paulie, as if displeased with him. With a man90so sensitive and suspicious as Gatto this would throw him off the track or at least leave himuncertain. Undue friendliness would make him wary. But of course the curtness must not be tooangry. It had to be rather an absentminded sort of irritation. And why Lampone? Paulie wouldfind that most alarming, especially since Lampone had to be in the rear seat. Paulie wouldn’t likebeing helpless at the wheel with Lampone behind his head. Clemenza rubbed and polished themetal of his Cadillac furiously. It was going to be tricky. Very tricky. For a moment he debatedwhether to recruit another man but decided against it. Here he followed basic reasoning. In yearsto come a situation might arise where it might be profitable for one of his partners to testifyagainst him. If there were just one accomplice it was one’s word against the other. But the wordof a second accomplice could swing the balance. No, they would stick to procedure. What annoyed Clemenza was that the execution had to be “public.” That is, the body wasto be found. He would have much preferred having it disappear. (Usual burying grounds werethe nearby ocean or the swamplands of New Jersey on land owned by friends of the Family or byother more complicated methods.) But it had to be public so that embryo traitors would befrightened and the enemy warned that the Corleone Family had by no means gone stupid or soft.Sollozzo would be made wary by this quick discovery of his spy. The Corleone Family wouldwin back some of its prestige. It had been made to look foolish by the shooting of the old man. Clemenza sighed. The Cadillac gleamed like a huge blue steel egg, and he was nowherenear the solving of his problem. Then the solution hit him, logical and to the point. It wouldexplain Rocco Lampone, himself and Paulie being together and give them a mission of sufficientsecrecy and importance. He would tell Paulie that their job today was to find an apartment in case the Familydecided to “go to the mattresses.” Whenever a war between the Families became bitterly intense, the opponents would setup headquarters in secret apartments where the “soldiers” could sleep on mattresses scatteredthrough the rooms. This was not so much to keep their families out of danger, their wives andlittle children, since any attack on noncombatants was undreamed of. All parties were toovulnerable to similar retaliation. But it was always smarter to live in some secret place whereyour everyday movements could not be charted either by your opponents or by some police whomight arbitrarily decide to meddle. And so usually a trusted caporegime would be sent out to rent a secret apartment and fill91it with mattresses. That apartment would be used as a sally port into the city when an offensivewas mounted. It was natural for Clemenza to be sent on such an errand. It was natural for him totake Gatto and Lampone with him to arrange all the details, including the furnishing of theapartment. Also, Clemenza thought with a grin, Paulie Gatto had proved he was greedy and thefirst thought that would pop into his head was how much he could get from Sollozzo for thisvaluable intelligence. Rocco Lampone arrived early and Clemenza explained what had to be done and whattheir roles would be. Lampone’s face lit up with surprised gratitude and he thanked Clemenzarespectfully for the promotion allowing him to serve the Family. Clemenza was sure he had donewell. He clapped Lampone on the shoulder and said, “You’ll get something better for your livingafter today. We’ll talk about that later. You understand the Family now is occupied with morecritical matters, more important things to do.” Lampone made a gesture that said he would bepatient, knowing his reward was certain. Clemenza went to his den’s safe and opened it. He took out a gun and gave it to Lampone.“Use this one,” he said. “They can never trace it. Leave it in the car with Paulie. When this job isfinished I want you to take your wife and children on a vacation to Florida. Use your own moneynow and I’ll pay you back later. Relax, get the sun. Use the Family hotel in Miami Beach so I’llknow where I can get you when I want.” Clemenza’s wife knocked on the door of the den to tell them that Paulie Gatto had arrived.He was parked in the driveway. Clemenza led the way through the garage and Lamponefollowed him. When Clemenza got into the front seat with Gatto he merely grunted in greeting,an exasperated look on his face. He looked at his wristwatch as if he expected to find that Gattowas late. The ferret-faced button man was watching him intently, looking for a clue. He flinched alittle when Lampone got into the rear seat behind him and said, “Rocco, sit on the other side. Abig guy like you blocks up my rear-view mirror.” Lampone shifted dutifully so that he wassitting behind Clemenza, as if such a request was the most natural thing in the world. Clemenza said sourly to Gat to, “Damn that Sonny, he’s running scared. He’s alreadythinking of going to the mattresses. We have to find a place on the West Side. Paulie, you andRocco gotta staff and supply it until the word comes down for the rest of the soldiers to use it.You know a good location?”92 As he had expected, Gatto ‘s eyes became greedily interested. Paulie had swallowed thebait and because he was thinking how much the information was worth to Sollozzo, he wasforgetting to think about whether he was in danger. Also, Lampone was acting his part perfectly,staring out the window in a disinterested, relaxed way. Clemenza congratulated himself on hischoice. Gatto shrugged. “I’d have to think about it,” he said. Clemenza grunted. “Drive while you think, I want to get to New York today.” Paulie was an expert driver and traffic going into the city was light at this time in theafternoon, so the early winter darkness was just beginning to fall when they arrived. There wasno small talk in the car. Clemenza directed Paulie to drive up to the Washington Heights section.He checked a few apartment buildings and told him to park near Arthur Avenue and wait. Healso left Rocco Lampone in the car. He went into the Vera Mario Restaurant and had a lightdinner of veal and salad, nodding his hellos to some acquaintances. After an hour had gone by hewalked the several blocks to where the car was parked and entered it. Gatto and Lampone werestill waiting. “Shit,” Clemenza said, “they want us back in Long Beach. They got some other jobfor us now. Sonny says we can let this one go until later. Rocco, you live in the city, can we dropyou off?” Rocco said quietly, “I have my car out at your place and my old lady needs it first thingin the morning.” “That’s right,” Clemenza said. “Then you have to come back with us, after all.” Again on the ride back to Long Beach nothing was said. On the stretch of road that ledinto the city, Clemenza said suddenly, “Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak.” From workingtogether so long, Gatto knew the fat caporegime had a weak bladder. He had often made such arequest. Gatto pulled the car off the highway onto the soft earth that led to the swamp. Clemenzaclimbed out of the car and took a few steps into the bushes. He actually relieved himself. Then ashe opened the door to get back into the car he took a quick look up and down the highway. Therewere no lights, the road was completely dark. “Go ahead,” Clemenza said. A second later theinterior of the car reverberated with the report of a gun. Paulie Gatto seemed to jump forward,his body flinging against the steering wheel and then slumping over to the seat. Clemenza hadstepped back hastily to avoid being hit with fragments of skull bone and blood. Rocco Lampone scrambled out of the back seat. He still held the gun and he threw it into93the swamp. He and Clemenza walked hastily to a car parked nearby and got in. Lampone reachedunderneath the seat and found the key that had been left for them. He started the car and droveClemenza to his home. Then instead of going back by the same route, he took the Jones BeachCauseway right on through to the town of Merrick and onto the Meadowbrook Parkway until hereached the Northern State Parkway. He rode that to the Long Island Expressway and thencontinued on to the Whitestone Bridge and through the Bronx to his home in Manhattan.Chapter 7 On the night before the shooting of Don Corleone, his strongest and most loyal and mostfeared retainer prepared to meet with the enemy. Luca Brasi had made contact with the forces ofSollozzo several months before. He had done so on the orders of Don Corleone himself. He haddone so by frequenting the nightclubs controlled by the Tattaglia Family and by taking up withone of their top call girls. In bed with this call girl he grumbled about how he was held down inthe Corleone Family, how his worth was not recognized. After a week of this affair with the callgirl, Luca was approached by Bruno Tattaglia, manager of the nightclub. Bruno was theyoungest son, and ostensibly not connected with the Family business of prostitution. But hisfamous nightclub with its dancing line of long-stemmed beauties was the finishing school formany of the city hookers. The first meeting was all above-board, Tattaglia offering him a job to work in the Familybusiness as enforcer. The flirtation went on for nearly a month. Luca played his role of maninfatuated with a young beautiful girl, Bruno Tattaglia the role of a businessman trying to recruitan able executive from a rival. At one such meeting, Luca pretended to be swayed, then said,“But one thing must be understood. I will never go against the Godfather. Don Corleone is a manI respect. I understand that he must put his sons before me in the Family business.” Bruno Tattaglia was one of the new generation with a barely hidden contempt for the oldMoustache Petes like Luca Brasi, Don Corleone and even his own father. He was just a little toorespectful. Now he said, “My father wouldn’t expect you to do anything against the Corleones.Why should he? Everybody gets along with everybody else now, it’s not like the old days. It’sjust that if you’re looking for a new job, I can pass along the word to my father. There’s alwaysneed for a man like you in our business. It’s a hard business and it needs hard men to keep it94running smooth. Let me know if you ever make up your mind.” Luca shrugged. “It’s not so bad where I’m at.” And so they left it. The general idea had been to lead the Tattaglias to believe that he knew about thelucrative narcotics operation and that he wanted a piece of it free-lance. In that fashion he mighthear something about Sollozzo’s plans if the Turk had any, or whether he was getting ready tostep on the toes of Don Corleone. After waiting for two months with nothing else happening,Luca reported to the Don that obviously Sollozzo was taking his defeat graciously. The Don hadtold him to keep trying but merely as a sideline, not to press it. Luca had dropped into the nightclub the evening before Don Corleone’s being shot.Almost immediately Bruno Tattaglia had come to his table and sat down. “I have a friend who wants to talk to you,” he said. “Bring him over,” Luca said. “I’ll talk to any friend of yours.” “No,” Bruno said. “He wants to see you in private.” “Who is he?” Luca asked. “Just a friend of mine,” Bruno Tattaglia said. “He wants to put a proposition to you. Canyou meet him later on tonight?” “Sure,” Luca said. “What time and where?” Tattaglia said softly, “The club closes at four in the morning. Why don’t you meet in herewhile the waiters are cleaning up?” They knew his habits, Luca thought, they must have been checking him out. He usuallygot up about three or four in the afternoon and had breakfast, then amused himself by gamblingwith cronies in the Family or had a girl. Sometimes he saw one of the midnight movies and thenwould drop in for a drink at one of the clubs. He never went to bed before dawn. So thesuggestion of a four A.M. meeting was not as outlandish as it seemed. “Sure, sure,” he said. “I’ll be back at four.” He left the club and caught a cab to hisfurnished room on Tenth Avenue. He boarded with an Italian family to which he was distantlyrelated. His two rooms were separated from the rest of their railroad flat by a special door. He
